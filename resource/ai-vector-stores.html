<p>If you start with loose data made by a human, and you need to search with it or against it, then a traditional RDB isn't great technology.   But if you spend more time on loading the data into a VectorDB, better grade of search can be achieved.  Quite a few search engines built a version of vector search a long time ago.<br />
To service these, there is a large group of data storage engines that I currently am learning about, so I am discovering.   In this article and the attached ones, it is necessary to avoid content made via AI #leSigh.   These are currently used for LLM-based Chatbots (etc.).   In the following paragraph Types are capitalised, if I make them italic as in other articles, most of the paragraph would be in italic.   A Vector-store is just software to store Vectors dot dot dot.   A Vector ~ when used for AI ~ is an Array of Floats <sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-database" target="_blank">1</a></sup> ~ <sub>this doc is long, but has no internal ids, so I can't reference “pages”</sub>.   Each Float represents a position in a Dimension, and is supposed to model the meaning of the source text, in a fashion that associates random letter / Char Strings which are similar things ~ e.g., a car is similar to a taxi and a truck <sup><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-large-language-models-fuel-the-rise-of-vector-databases/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, but textual based analysis can't tell you that.   Notes say the only valuable Vectors are non-zero and are Dense.   I guess they must be a SparseArray, or it wouldn't be possible not to store the zeros, OR the Dimensions are set in advance, and it's a large Struct.   TODO: IOIO I should read source code to confirm this.<br />
According to <sup><a href="https://www.ciopages.com/vector-databases/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> Vector DB are sometimes used for 3D model data, or geometric information.  They also state fraud detection, but graph databases are a better structure for that.  They do not mention any dedicated Vector stores, favouring pgVector, MongoDB arrays and similar.   The long text <sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-database" target="_blank">4</a></sup> offers LLM backing and search indices.   According to <sup><a href="https://myscale.com/blog/vector-store-vs-vector-database-comparison-guide/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, there are Vector DB and Vector Stores <sup><a href="https://myscale.com/blog/vector-store-vs-vector-database-comparison-guide/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-store" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/predict/vector-store-anlysis-exploring-popular-solutions-63eba05f27a7" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, and most people will want the DB as they gain from the extra features.  Simplicity will help the remaining users as the need <del>giga-scale</del><ins>tera-scale</ins> operations (same principal as ColumnDB).   <sup><a href="https://malaikannan.github.io/2024/08/31/VectorDB/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> observes that “capacity” for Vector searches isn't the same quality as “built and optimised for” Vector searches ~ although the PG team release slowly and optimise a lot.</p>


<aside class="pullout">
<p>SIDE TRACK: There is an old service called Wordnet that had some scheme to map words to more generic versions, like a hierarchical database.   <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn" target="_blank">wordnet</a> ~ warn HTTP link <sup><a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/1928/WordNetAn-Electronic-Lexical-Database" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://wordnet-online.com/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   Official releases of Wordnet <sup><a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, and there will probably be a wrapper library in your favourite scripting language.  This project has been running since 1985, initially in en_US, but now supports 200 languages (ref: jump to Wiki below).   The first edition was written in Perl, and I see L Wall's / T Christiansen's style all over this project.   People who like words-about-words will be very happy with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet" target="_blank">wiki</a> article.   The data in Wordnet is put into a framework with a rigid high-level Semantic Structure.   Every physical object word extends Object eventually.   Every adjective is eventually forming an aspect of a generic base opposing pair (e.g. hot &lt;==&gt; cold etc).   Verbs are also stored in specificness Trees <sup><a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, but they didn't mention how many root nodes (UPDATE a `grep` shows 15 base Verbs).</p>

<p>I don't think Wordnet is used for Vectorisation.</p>


</aside>
<p>Approximate matching for Floats is less advanced than for Strings.  Vector stores generically use an NNS <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.   Semantic matching via the Vectors is expressed numerically as the numbers of each vector being similar to each other <sup><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-large-language-models-fuel-the-rise-of-vector-databases/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.   Faster databases favour ANN <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.19284v2" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/understanding-ann" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9942356/metrics#metrics" target="_blank">5</a></sup> to cull the irrelevant data faster.   A better level of detail, described in <sup><a href="https://zilliz.com/learn/advanced-querying-techniques-in-vector-databases" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.codesmith.io/blog/vector-databases-deep-dive" target="_blank">7</a></sup> is HNSW (Hierarchical navigable small world) <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, IVF (Inverted File Index) <sup><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-with-ivfpq-9c6348fd4db3" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbours Oh Yeah) <sup><a href="https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/glossary/annoy-approximate-nearest-neighbors-oh-yeah/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   A comparison list of algorithms <sup><a href="https://medium.com/kx-systems/how-vector-databases-search-by-similarity-a-comprehensive-primer-c4b80d13ce63" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/@serkan_ozal/vector-similarity-search-53ed42b951d9" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.   One of the optimisation strategies is to organise the data via a BSP <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning" target="_blank">13</a></sup> ~ which for me is a well-known work-in-advance algorithm from the 80-90s.   I saw a lecture on Gaussian splatting <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_splatting" target="_blank">14</a></sup> as a faster approximation than BSP ~ which was designed as a pre-process step.   One of the common algorithms for comparing batches of Vectors e.g. <sup><a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/conText/man/nns_ratio.html" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.nieveconsulting.com/blog/demystifying-semantic-search-step-by-step-semantic-search-engine-implementation/" target="_blank">16</a></sup> is Cosine similarity.   This has many names, please see <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.   A similar algorithm that could be used is Jaccard <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, which was discovered several times before the internet was common, so has several names.   None of the examples that I see online include negative numbers, BUT if you are using cosine curves, 50% of the “number volume” is negative, discussed in <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-if-I-got-negative-values-for-vectors" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.   I think the average representation of a Vector is disingenuous, the scalar of each dimension is shown, but the vector isn't (in the most simple model, it would be a array offset).   If you have an 100 item array and the first 30 items are unused for “king of hearts card”, the empty slots are needed to differentiate from “oyster farm” which has 30 empty slots at the end of the storage array, regardless about when the used slots have the same values.<br />
Vector DBs often can automatically tokenise a query string into Vectors performing a search.  According to <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/10/09/from-prototype-to-production-vector-databases-in-generative-ai-applications/" target="_blank">20</a></sup>, Vector DB often supplements the Vector search with traditional textual / lexical searches.   Getting data on how VectorDBs work <sup><a href="https://malaikannan.github.io/2024/08/31/VectorDB/" target="_blank">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vector-search" target="_blank">22</a></sup> mentions that VectorDB have different indexes:  For a high-granularity low-level review of comparing numbers ~ measuring speed ~ some process to precisely understand the hardware being used is essential, some discussion on register types <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550281/floating-point-vs-integer-calculations-on-modern-hardware" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1121419/why-separate-floating-point-registers-intel-x64-processors" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.  As a more advanced discussion on hardware, some algorithms are fast as they align with the design of hardware <sup><a href="https://medium.com/@kumon/similarity-search-scann-and-4-bit-pq-ab98766b32bd" target="_blank">25</a></sup> specifically SIMD <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data" target="_blank">26</a></sup>.   When the VectorDB needs to compare <del>millions</del><ins>trillions</ins> of numbers (Vectors) to return the adjacent ones, the registers will have large impact.</p>

<p>During 2020 Google released some OSS with an implementation for ScaNN Vector search <a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/scann/docs/algorithms.md" target="_blank">git</a> <sup><a href="https://research.google/blog/announcing-scann-efficient-vector-similarity-search/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://research.google/blog/soar-new-algorithms-for-even-faster-vector-search-with-scann/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> which they claim is a newer tweak for fast search.  This statically posterises the Vector space into areas / cells ~ compare to BSP ~  and performs a faster but more vague search against every cell's indexes first to reduce computation needed.  There's an algorithm called NGT (Neighbourhood Graph and Tree) <sup><a href="https://github.com/yahoojapan/NGT/wiki/Command-Quick-Referenc" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/10/ngt-open-source-library" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, which is a better edition of ANN.   There are many other tree-based indexes used in a PG DB <sup><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/indexes-types.html" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://learnpostgres.dev/article/PostgreSQL_Indexes_A_Complete_Guide.html" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, Oracle <sup><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/CREATE-INDEX.html" target="_blank">7</a></sup> (reference has images to describe each index)  or a generic DB <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index" target="_blank">8</a></sup> index algorithm: <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.<br />
It looks like all the useful VectorDB systems use several different algorithms depending on scale and density of the data <sup><a href="https://www.codesmith.io/blog/vector-databases-deep-dive" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://lantern.dev/blog/vectordb" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://zilliz.com/learn/advanced-querying-techniques-in-vector-databases" target="_blank">12</a></sup> ~ this would match my expectations, as PG does this.  The databases optimised for looser data types (VectorDB, GraphDB, GISDB, FullText DB) tend to consume more RAM than an RDB.   A survey comparing VectorDB <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01763v2" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, for a more advanced reading level, see contents of this biblio.   It benchmarks available software in versions released between 2020 and 2023.</p>

<p>There's a list of multistage search algorithms that <em>return results</em>, not allowing faster access to data.   A list of Indexes written in Sept 2024 will age as lots of people would like a faster search.   I have dropped a few toy indexes which do not seem to be used in practice, but are easy to diagram / explain, so they are part of “intro notes” ~ probably made by a LLM-AI.  It's possible that different companies publish notes with different names on purpose for exact same algorithms. They can claim they haven't copied any ones else's property ~ not all these index ideas are complex.  Different terminology leads to duplicate items.<br />
I have moved the terminology log to the <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/ai-dictionary#">dictionary article</a>, this allows better concentration on VectorDB, rather than data storage.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>I have a large gap in publications as I see nothing from the large Chinese internet based corporations, who must have all these processes.  I see many Mandarin names (written in EN, with the paper in EN) as authors on journal articles, so there are software engineers doing work in that area. </li>
    <li>I also didn't find any authors from languages spoken in India/Bharat, but India has a strong search market as expected for the world's most populous country ~ see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/external-search#">external-search</a>.   As nearly all this work in my article is “post internet”, this is concerning.  </li>
    <li>I think “word2vec for Mandarin” would be interesting, and if Vector heaps were portable, so zh-CN Vectors could be used for EN structures, doubly so.  I think to a low level of detail that is is how Google Translate is functioning.  </li>
    <li>A useful article listing best index per data scale <sup><a href="https://thesequence.substack.com/p/guest-post-choosing-the-right-vector" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>“Fast” is a silent word, as “newer design which exists to improve previous design that is slower than desired” is a description for a large amount of the internet.</li>
    <li>Architecture note ~ as two maths concepts, a Tree is a directed Graph.  A Tree is a structure suited to being used as an Index, and most [realistic] Indexes are Trees.  A large hash-based system may be implemented with Trees if it is too large to fit in memory.   A common example for that is a file-system.  </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Query structures <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Due to the more “knowledge-based search” approach of a VectorDB, the query languages seem to be simpler (compared to “data-based search” of an RDB).   Unlike traditional RDB, it's advisable to have a terminate-early structure on queries (like a recursion-algo break-clause, or a SQL LIMIT clause), since there is an indeterminate list of values that match the query.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>All the Index entries that mention 'search' are presented as a software library with a class API rather than a language REPL.   There isn't that much interaction difference between a REPL and an API, but this is definitely a culture change.   A naïve guess would be that the earlier tools written in C were including a REPL to make usage easier, but I think this seems wrong as many of the more modern projects were C++, with the same usage.</li>
    <li>The following set of examples is quite boring, as this looks like a commodity market.   If they are mostly the same, the following list of supported indexes will help differentiate them <sup><a href="https://medium.com/the-ai-forum/which-vector-database-should-you-use-choosing-the-best-one-for-your-needs-5108ec7ba133" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>If all the DB communicate via HTTP rather than a faster protocol, I hope they support all the HTTP optimisations.  This seems an ideal situation for Protobuf <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.   Other [older] DB have a binary protocol, which supports higher transfer rates than HTTP.</li>
    <li>Pinecone <sup><a href="https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/query-data" target="_blank">17</a></sup> has an access library for a list of languages, and supports full CRUD.   As a DBaaS ~ this option isn't opensource ~ it includes some pre-trained models, but these are PAYG <sup><a href="https://docs.pinecone.io/models/overview" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Milvus <sup><a href="https://milvus.io/docs/v2.3.x/query.md" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://milvus.io/docs/get-and-scalar-query.md" target="_blank">20</a></sup> has an access library for a list of languages.  </li>
    <li>Qdrant <sup><a href="https://api.qdrant.tech/master/api-reference/search/query-points" target="_blank">21</a></sup> seems currently to only offer a REST API.   Although, they also say <sup><a href="https://qdrant.tech/articles/hybrid-search/" target="_blank">22</a></sup> which is a class API.</li>
    <li>Chroma has a HTTP and asyncHTTP libraries <sup><a href="https://docs.trychroma.com/guides" target="_blank">23</a></sup>, and supports JS and Python clients.</li>
    <li>Weaviate <sup><a href="https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/tutorials/query" target="_blank">24</a></sup> seems to include some SQL features <sup><a href="https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/similarity" target="_blank">25</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>This list is not complete, but it <strong>highlights that the choice of VectorDB shouldn't depend on the access client</strong> as the client libraries are very similar.  </li>
</ul>

<p>All the demo projects I saw could easily be hosted in any modern RDB ~ possibly even IndexDB in your browser ~ as an index range of 10^6 is trivial on modern hardware.  Clearly, the small demo is to show structures so larger and more meaningful systems could be built. <br />
There is a VectorDB bench project for comparing search via VectorDB <sup><a href="https://zilliz.com/learn/open-source-vector-database-benchmarking-your-way" target="_blank">26</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://zilliz.com/learn/benchmark-vector-database-performance-techniques-and-insights" target="_blank">27</a></sup> ~ note it is made by one of the DB manufacturers <a href="https://github.com/zilliztech/VectorDBBench" target="_blank">git</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/" target="_blank">git</a>.</p>

<p>Most successful DB projects can do a Vector index these days, and there are some niche ones that only store Vectors.   Note: content did not include libraries to convert user input to Vectors for the vector matching.  I pulled some performance graphs for the different DB <sup><a href="https://github.com/zilliztech/VectorDBBench?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">28</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://jina.ai/news/benchmark-vector-search-databases-with-one-million-data/" target="_blank">29</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://redis.io/blog/benchmarking-results-for-vector-databases/" target="_blank">30</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/" target="_blank">31</a></sup> ~ note the last two are made by a Vendor.</p>

    <li>To scale from 1 customer to 1000 customers use whatever DB your devs are fastest with, and focus on defining the problem.  </li>
    <li>For 1000 to 1,000,000 customers setup a dedicated infrastructure for Vectors, and whatever is fastest at that scale.  This medium size business needs to work on standardisation to attract larger clients and enterprise.   </li>
    <li>For 1,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 customers, now think about all the <i>bells and whistles</i> that the DB vendors advertised earlier, and networking.   Most micro optimisations do not make impact at smaller scale, and may slow your business operations.   To misquote <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@peppermintcompany/premature-optimization-is-evil-2deaefc00f4d" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, premature optimisation is the root of all [software] evil. </li>
</ul>

<p>When basic speed is your highest value metric, I think Redis will always win, and definitely questions <i>why pay for a niche DB</i>.  There will need to be a more complex and multi-step process for a larger data scale.  Maybe a really big Redis would need to be sharded to support that scale of data.  If the data is too large to fit in RAM (notes on larger scale operations <sup><a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2023/11/24/llm-mem.html" target="_blank">2</a></sup>), the dedicated Vector DB may also need some sharding process too.  As LLM are built in layers and iterations, a slower speed LLM can run each section separately on recycled RAM <sup><a href="https://verdagon.dev/blog/llm-throughput-not-ram-limited" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   The numbers from the last link exclude many phones, and the process wold flatten the batteries quickly.</p>

<p>Many of the adverts for the Vector specific software state they have very optimised performance compared to a RDB for Vectors at expected usage volumes.   The established DB vendors reviewed, then agreed, and added a new feature, just like they did for GIS index, and queriable XML storage.   Until the dedicated Vector stores have enough maturity to not use HTTP as a inter-process comms mechanism (as its not fast enough), a cautious engineer should test all options carefully when trying to scale.</p>

<p>Having a storage optimised for Vectors in useful for projects and products using vectors.   This should be achievable with additional money if that is important to the project.   Processes with Vectors do consume noticeable amounts of power, whichever strategy is used.   Vectors DB are an extreme version of BASE architecture <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.</p>
