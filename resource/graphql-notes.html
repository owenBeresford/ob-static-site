<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > GraphQL is: <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>A spec <sup><a href="https://spec.graphql.org/draft/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, like REST</li>
    <li>A uniform way to access real API, and DB (like an ORM), with less code.  A sales pitch is <i>“to simplify integration to multiple existing API”</i></li>
    <li>In terms of architecture, a library that supplies client and server side; operated via a schema.  The client request is sent to the GraphQL server as a single unit; and forms a composite query.  Can glue things together <sup><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/" target="_blank">2</a></sup></li>
    <li>Better argument against REST: REST designed in 2000 doesn't meet current market; rich apps are complex; faster iterations than jigging REST and client as separate things are desirable.  </li>
    <li>GraphQL server uses “type” that look like typescript interfaces, but use a '!' for required; 'Schema definition language' <sup><a href="https://cloudyforsure.com/graphql/graphql-schema/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  Logically, a legacy XML API (i.e. code from 2000-2010) could be ported straight to GraphQL transparently, as SOAP and GraphQL offer similar features.</li>
    <li>JS reference implementation <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js" target="_blank">git</a></li>
    <li>Basic contract: Query <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, Mutation <sup><a href="https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/graphql-mutations/" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, and Subscription <sup><a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/subscriptions/" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Server-side limiting features <sup><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/securing-graphql-api-using-rate-limits-and-depth-limits/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>: Timeouts <sup><a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/queries/timeout.html" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, Maximum Query Depth, Complexity <sup><a href="https://typegraphql.com/docs/complexity.html" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, Throttling <sup><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/throttling" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.  These are the same algorithms used in a plain RDB, tuning values can be pulled from other platform docs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018, GraphQL was badly advertised. Quite a lot of those adverts were to the effect of “you don't have to learn to use SQL 'join' if you replace everything with GraphQL, as this will do it for you”; it is not advisable to ask people who cannot use SQL to create API over an RDB.<br />
</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Advantages / benefits <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>These points are a detailed summary from <sup><a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/graphql-core-features-architecture-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.atatus.com/glossary/graphql/#benefits-of-graphql" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stablekernel.com/article/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-graphql/" target="_blank">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/kocfinanstech/benefits-of-using-graphql-11d6c8a0104a" target="_blank">15</a></sup></p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>GraphQL people say API wrapping has faster performance and less overheads <i>not sure if dev performance or code performance.</i></li>
    <li>Good fit for complex systems and micro-services; fetching composite data with a single API call.  If you have many micro-services (so they are more stable in the presence of requirements changes and rollout windows ); using GraphQL reduces the amount of work on the frontend to integrate, and keep things running <sup><a href="https://sonspring.com/journal/front-end-gotchas-of-graphql/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.  <i>Strong point, again supporting rate of change</i></li>
    <li>No over- and under-fetching problems.  <i>Not a problem I have seen with REST</i>, seems a strong feature for FOAF datasets (that would need many joins in an RDB).</li>
    <li>Client writes requests inside a preset schema, and can also transform data. <i>Where the data comes from a local DB, this is useful. </i></li>
    <li>Included features: Validation and type checking, auto-generating API documentation, API evolution without versioning, Code-sharing, Permissions are all 'out-of-the-box'.  <i>If these are faster to build via schema than server framework tooling, this is good value</i>.  However these features are not unique to GraphQL.  Business value: Can hire less good developers, as these features are performed by the library, rather than the staff created code.</li>
    <li>Rapid application prototyping is easy. <i>A strong point for agile teams with uncertain goals/ aims</i></li>
    <li>Should be less legacy XML for developers to deal with.</li>
    <li>Can 'hotswap' database structures without the client noticing (e.g. Postgres cluster to Redis); this is also true for a REST API.</li>
    <li>PubSub pattern “for free”/ no dev cost, as its a GraphQL library feature.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Negatives/ liabilities <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Performance issues with complex queries.  <i>There's always performance issues with complex queries: as ever, no change</i></li>
    <li>Web caching is more complex as all GraphQL requests return HTTP200.  Can be managed by creating UUID <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/caching/#globally-unique-ids" target="_blank">17</a></sup> on the server.</li>
    <li>Overkill for small applications.  <i>This was built for Facebook; a library doesn't need to be deployed in every situation.</i>  As a more general statement “where do you want to pay the complexity tax?&quot; <sup><a href="https://sonspring.com/journal/front-end-gotchas-of-graphql/" target="_blank">18</a></sup></li>
    <li>File uploading isn't supported (no selfie feature); so something like an AWS S3 integration would need to remain.</li>
    <li>Developers need to be trained/ upgraded, and this takes time. <i>The query language is like Elasticsearch, I don't think that learning another language is a big problem so this point should be last.</i></li>
</ul>

<summary> <h4 id="toc3" ><a href="#toc3"> Reads (query/aggregates) <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert"></i></sup> </a></h4></summary>
<p>I have not done similar listing of query structures for any other DB discussed on the website; but I had operational use of the each DB first.  Secondly note that many RDB support the same common grammar, SQL98 or greater.  GraphQL is its own spec and project.  I think this section is very boring, and I wrote it.</p>

<p>Simple list of concepts for queries:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>These are equivalent to SQL select... </li>
    <li>The API request/ response are JSON dictionaries <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  The request lists items to return; and the response has a “data” key, then the requested fields if present.  This resembles MongoDB.  </li>
    <li>The queries can include calls to “functions” (this is what the syntax looks like), these request to pull data from a specific “object” (commonly a database table).  The “calls” can take <b>arguments</b>, which are a notation matching SQL 'where clauses'.   </li>
    <li>The docs outline subqueries <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, which they call <strong>aliases</strong>.  </li>
    <li>In order to reduce required typing on big queries, GraphQL has a <b>fragment</b> structure <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, which resembles a typescript interface; this doesn't map to SQL structure that I can think of. </li>
    <li>The Fragments can be decomposed, known as “inline fragments” <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Generally a useful query would be used like a prepared statement, and have a name i.e. start with “query $name”; GraphQL calls this <b>operation name</b> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.   Obviously the query type could be one of other supported actions, which are listed in the first section. </li>
    <li>Secondly, the operation and name thing supports arguments/ <strong>variables</strong> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#using-variables-inside-fragments" target="_blank">8</a></sup> (I think they used a different name here to make it easier for casual readers to keep track).  The use of variables resembles calling the named operation as a function (see docs for this item); this is extended as variables may have default values.  It is also possible to use “search” as the verb <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#meta-fields" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, and get the “object type”, which they call __typename.</li>
    <li>The docs note that there is locking in effect <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#multiple-fields-in-mutations" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, exactly same as RDB.  </li>
    <li>The “function bodies” support branching <strong>directives</strong> <strong>@include</strong> and <strong>@skip</strong> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives" target="_blank">11</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Confused readers may gain from the text in the canonical docs, in the first link in each line, that have a lot of simple examples.</p>

<summary><h4 id="toc4" ><a href="#toc4"> Writes (mutations etc) <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert"></i></sup> </a></h4></summary>
<p>This is focussed on <strong>mutations</strong> i.e. a map of SQL insert, update and delete operations; <strong>types</strong>, to enforce that expected data is present (same as SQL schema); and <strong>validation</strong> rules, which would map to SQL constraints, triggers and storproc, and REST behaviours.  If a dev has somehow skipped past Typescript, static typing in GraphQL will come as a shock.  The best practices are fairly predictable <sup><a href="https://fauna.com/blog/graphql-mutations#best-practices-for-graph-ql-mutations" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/comments/g6gfxr/best_mutation_design_practice/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/graphql-what-is-the-best-practice-for-updating-arrays-of-objects-in-a-mutation-b3b1d9b411" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, naming things is a) important, b) hard <sup><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices/" target="_blank">4</a></sup></p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>These match an SQL update operation, and are described <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://fauna.com/blog/graphql-mutations#how-to-use-mutations-in-graph-ql" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-mutations/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>As noted in the first section, GraphQL DSL has a <strong>type</strong> keyword, and this is used to define Typescript interfaces.  It uses '!' to indicate required status; see example in <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.  The notes say do not assume people are using JS on the server, but the DSL is very similar to JS/ TS.</li>
    <li>GraphQL DSL supports Enum type <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types" target="_blank">10</a></sup> </li>
    <li>GraphQL has a <strong>schema</strong> keyword <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#the-query-and-mutation-types" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, which is used to define “Objects” used in the queries.</li>
    <li>GraphQL DSL supports arrays/ <strong>lists</strong> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://graphql-ruby.org/type_definitions/lists.html" target="_blank">13</a></sup> and supports a useful amount of 'null controls', i.e. process to regulate absent data (same section of docs).  In both queries and responses <sup><a href="https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/queries/search-filtering/#query-a-list-of-objects" target="_blank">14</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>On the server side, GraphQL, seems to have <strong>interfaces</strong>, which behave like Typescript interfaces <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces" target="_blank">15</a></sup>; confusingly Types may extend them ?? and <strong>union</strong> types <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types" target="_blank">16</a></sup>, used when there is no common data between options.</li>
    <li>For data structures that are used as “form posts”, the keyword <strong>input</strong> is very relevant <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.  Input-side data cannot have arguments (as far as they are SQL where clauses, this wouldn't make sense). </li>
    <li><strong>Fragments</strong> are like a interface <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/validation/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, but used as a smaller reusable thing that is linked into larger structures.  The usage is very close to traits in OO.  Fragments may not be recursively defined, or have a closed definition graph.  </li>
    <li>There are limits on what data can be requested <sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.1.x?topic=api-graphql-limitations" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/" target="_blank">20</a></sup>; I think I will need to write myself some unit tests on that, as the manual isn't clear.  It says you can't invent a single char field from a string field; but I would build that outcome as a decorator, or a transform using a boutique SQL index.</li>
    <li>The DSL does support inline fragments <sup><a href="https://docs.eduflow.com/graphql/inline-fragments" target="_blank">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://ckimes89.gitbooks.io/graphql-net/content/docs/queries_and_mutations/inline-fragments.html" target="_blank">22</a></sup>, that look like PHP or Python 'with clauses'.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what code that needs to be present to supply data requests <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers" target="_blank">1</a></sup>; <i>quelle surprise</i> this looks like a REST API in a modern framework.  Notes in the official manual in this section are much shorter.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>As a system based on the JS engine, it has native support for asynchronous data streams.</li>
    <li>The manual explains the process of resolving the query/ mutation; after validation is execution...   </li>
    <li>The library supports translating DB enums to “casual normie strings”, but doesn't describe how.</li>
    <li>The library supports introspection features, which return data like how SQL explain does <sup><a href="https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>All magic tricks in GraphQL start with a '__', similar to C.  Accepted values are __Schema, __Type, __TypeKind, __Field, __InputValue, __EnumValue, __Directive</li>
    <li>Thorough use of introspection fields gives you a resultset that looks like a Schema or a legacy UDDI/WSD description file <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Discovery" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/web-service-discovery" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.</li>
