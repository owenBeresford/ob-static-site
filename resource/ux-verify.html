<p>Common requirements for high reliability UI testing</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Demonstrate product is usable in all browsers (with stable tests)</li>
    <li>Demonstrate branding is OK in all browsers</li>
</ul>


<h5 id="toc1"> Common requirements for QA UI testing</h5>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Demonstrate product correctly supports user stories/ scenarios</li>
    <li>Detect any weird crashes in obscure setups</li>
    <li>Ensure products are compliant with #a11y laws <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.out-law.com/page-330" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2016/12/05/plain-english-guide-eu-accessibility-directive/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/WEBGUIDE/12.+Accessibility" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>Not a business requirement, but sometimes people look at CPU usage; to make the product more palatable</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2017, I am using Mocha as my primary test tool in JS.  It can be run as BDD or a TDD, so there is less tool management.<br />
Mocha can be run in browser <sup><a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/running-mocha-tests-as-native-es6-modules-in-a-browser-882373f2ecb0" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42857778/how-do-you-run-mocha-tests-in-the-browser" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  I have not found a extension like Swarm <sup><a href="https://libraries.io/npm/swarm-js/0.1.21" target="_blank">7</a></sup> for Mocha, but Jenkins <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30458114/running-jenkins-job-with-multiple-browsers" target="_blank">8</a></sup> would work as a substitute.  This article isn't about distributed testing, but Swarm seems like a good idea, good enough to be used for testing jQuery releases <sup><a href="https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.  For forking and parallel running, Jasmine is a better organised tool <sup><a href="https://www.seleniumeasy.com/protractor-angularjs-tutorials/run-tests-on-multiple-browsers-parallel" target="_blank">10</a></sup>. <br />
Also look at <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/jest-dom" target="_blank">11</a></sup><br />
<b>UPDATE</b> In 2021 or later, MSIE is no more and I have changed my target edition of JS, so I am using different tools.  For traditional unit-tests, I use Jest for its vast array of plugins, or <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/vitest#">Vitest</a>.  For visual and Component tests, I am using <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/storybook#">storybook</a>.  I normally run some tests inside a browser as knowing about actual browser issues is important, and <del>many test frameworks</del><ins>all the test frameworks that I know about</ins> fail to implement the whole of CSS.   I push as many visual features into CSS as it normally uses less RAM, it runs smoother, and this leaves your <em>sole thread</em> for data related processing.   Even using Jest, there is value being able to read normalised units, including after all the StyleCascade has been resolved.   So I will keep using my library described below. <br />
Further TODO:: <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/css-palette-extractor#">A pallete/ swatch builder</a>.  If your CSS and JS should make all the CTA buttons sky-blue-pink, but what happens if there is a browser spec compliance issue on CSS mumber rounding, and they show up black (cough, Safari)?  A swatch run in each browser is time saving step.   This must be run inside the browser(s).   <br />
Extra selectors for Aria-roles will be useful for showing better support for text2speech tools.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Literature search on test tools <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I did a quick literature search but didn't find anything useful.  Obviously many people use Selenium <sup><a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> to meet this requirement.  Jest <sup><a href="https://devhints.io/jest" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/testing-with-jest-from-zero-to-hero-85ce0e9cc953/" target="_blank">14</a></sup> has some relevant features, but lacks the data normalisation of my planned tool.<br />
UPDATE 2022: I found <sup><a href="https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react" target="_blank">16</a></sup> cheatsheet <sup><a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> whilst looking for something.  The extra tool is mostly “get an element with this text”, which is less like declarative code.  Whilst pulling references for this, I notice the recent jQuery has a &quot;:contains” search feature <sup><a href="https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, for text matching.  I will add a similar function to my library, as its a good idea.</p>

<p><b>objective: have a JS test tool to concisely make declarative UI statements about webpages/ webapps</b> (e.g. assert that all visible text is larger than 15px on screen).  This MUST be run in a webrowser, in the normal operating condition.  With this library, UI regression tests can be quickly defined.  A unit test, in a well maintained library, can be easily ran in all browsers. <br />
<b>Note:</b> I will add function chaining support soon, so a test may select an element then select aspects of child elements.  All features <em>can</em> currently take a DOM node, so this shouldn't be that hard.   Therefore, its easy to make a test with: “in Widget 31, tell me about any text smaller than 14px.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not intended to look at tag well-formed-ness, as that isn't UX/UI, but implementation.   If tag well-formed-ness is required in a unit-test; I would recommend tidy <sup><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/tidy" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.<br />
I am not focussing on page load speed, as there are many tools that do this.  It should be noted that there are many implementations / notations of features, and to be useful all of these need supporting.   For example a font size may be specified in px, pt, em, rem, %, vh, vw, vmin, vmax <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html#font-size" target="_blank">20</a></sup>, dp, su, sp, gp, gs, gr <sup><a href="https://github.com/alexfoxy/react-native-units" target="_blank">21</a></sup> and more.   The conversion will need to be done at runtime, as it is device and setting specific.   A person reading the whole of this site may note the overlap between this tool and <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/cain-project#">CAIN-project</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/cain-introduction#">cain-introduction</a>. <b>TODO 2024:</b> CSS ed5 adds more units, so the code will need to be extended <sup><a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-length-units/" target="_blank">22</a></sup> lists: FR, DPPX, X, viewport units, container units, and angle units.  These have enough support to include <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20unit%20cqw" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20unit%20fr" target="_blank">24</a></sup><br />
As a more applied analysis; the metrics in <sup><a href="https://davidwalsh.name/vital-web-performance" target="_blank">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/weekly-webtips/observer-apis-in-javascript-part-ii-5dba957295ab" target="_blank">26</a></sup> should be thought about.  Conveniently the same article says the required JS feature is already present in blink based browsers <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=PerformanceObserver" target="_blank">27</a></sup> so has a good level of support.   Please note there will need to be some work to get this feature loaded on page load, rather than after first paint.   I will work out how to convert the Observables events to a boolean statement for an unit assertion.  There are many blog articles on this API, but I used <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver/observe" target="_blank">28</a></sup> to write my test.   With regards to delayed input, <sup><a href="https://requestmetrics.com/web-performance/first-input-delay" target="_blank">29</a></sup> explains what the speed warnings on mouse-events in Chrome mean (built with same API).<br />
To use the PerformanceObserver feature; the JS blob will need to load TinyColor and PresentationAsserts before other libraries.  Maybe the most sensible process is to have two build scripts; one with “with test tools”, which at scale may also include Mocha, Chai etc; and one for “production”, without these deps.  The PresentationAsserts class is nearly stateless (TinyColor is the sole Object variable to avoid a global variable).  I will make a build later which is self executing; but I need to be careful about compatibility with class loaders. <br />
This feature is exposed as <i>pageRenderMetricsStart()</i> and <i>pageMetricsAcceptable()</i> but this just makes the underlying browser feature into a unit test feature.  I don't really have any say in weather it works or not.  Any users of this feature need to think carefully with any results (success or failure).   To repeat the last paragraph, it <em>can't work</em> if the PresentationAsserts code is loaded too late.   It would be possible to load with a null in place of the TinyColors, as that is less code, so faster.  Then inject the real one before running any tests that involve colour manipulation.</p>

<p>Current JS file is <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/oab1-conf/blob/main/lib/PresentationAsserts.js" target="_blank">available</a>, requires tinyColor.js; which is in the same folder in GIT.  I have a resource for a wide range of UTF-8 symbols; this is useful for testing utf8 support <sup><a href="https://kermitproject.org/utf8.html" target="_blank">30</a></sup>.  Another useful UTF-8 tool is <sup><a href="https://onlineunicodetools.com/escape-unicode" target="_blank">31</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://convertcodes.com/utf8-encode-decode-convert-string/" target="_blank">32</a></sup>, used for building escape sequences of UTF-8 literals.</p>
