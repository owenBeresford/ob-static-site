<p>I moved this from the home page as it was getting too big.  I need to edit pointless detail from here</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Only read if keen</b>; I know pages about the site you are reading are very boring.</li>
    <li>🖈 [Pegged] First comment: I am considering <strong>adding a new group called “boring” that holds most of the content</strong>.  Quite a few tech blogs exude a breathless excitement; I think this is a site to save time, and cannot impress anyone.</li>
    <li>🖈 [Pegged] Second comment: I learn and retain information better if I write it (studies show that handwriting is better again, but #leSigh).   I have processed what I read enough to use my own words, when I'm writing it.   See category “boring” above.   The articles that are tagged 'young tech' are only available after my degrees.   So without me having some mechanism for learning new stuff, I would be more old and useless.   Some people prefer watching videos.   </li>
    <li><b>April-June</b>: there is slowdown in fresh content, as I started to replace to replace JS from 2010 era, due to persistent whining from Github and Google.  See git repo for more details.</li>
    <li>Some of the early changes where a learning curve for me, but none of the ones after 2014 are.  I am adding more features to match the current scale of the data.</li>
    <li>This site has always been a UTF-8 site, this was more rare when I started it.</li>
    <li>The articles on this site reflect semantic-web concepts from 2004 era; they each have a meta header used to build the HTML head and for my custom indexing.</li>
    <li>One of the section headings on this homepage was “everyone is as good as their sources”. I removed that section; however you can see all my sources (all those Harvard style reference links, <strong>all of them</strong>.  Mean average of 30 or-so per article).</li>
    <li>In 2015, I added font-awesome for logos making the site load faster; in 2020, I replaced font-awesome with fontello as it's smaller again.</li>
    <li>In 2024, I recompressed my <em>compressed</em> WOFF2 fonts, as the place I had downloaded them from hadn't compressed properly. #leSigh, its just gzip.</li>
    <li>As random stats, I built a second index for discoverability, based in article name (used in the URL).  There only 4 widely used initial letters (): C..., J..., P..., and S...   This is an example of why I think alphabetical indexing is poor UX.  I defined 'widely used' to be more than 5% of articles, as I don't think I have more than 15 articles on the same same topic, so that implies the letter is used by multiple topics.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>This is the reason that github suggests random names.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>In 2017, I added the create date and edit date meta-data.  The last edit date feature is less useful than I would like (in 2020, then again end of 2022); as I needed to edit every single existing article to add more meta data.</li>
    <li>In 2018 I put articles in article groups to improve discoverability of content.  </li>
    <li>If I had spent one more day on site infrastructure in 2013, this would have been a JAMstack site since then.  <b>UPDATE 2022</b>: my webhost was bought; so I have done this.</li>
    <li>In the end of 2022, I updated many references to be HTTPS.   I think need a process to rebuild all the references every year at the least often, to update dead links.  I now have a link report on the end my site build script #leSigh.   In 2024, I have improved the error display on the references blobs, so bad references are clearly marked down, plus I can have a quality report on when I build the site.   I am also storing the JSON files with line-breaks ~ to make diffing easier ~ as it looks like I will need to update the JSON more often than I expected in 2015 when I started this interaction/ feature.</li>
    <li>In 2012 I made the site mobile capable (template v3); but I wasn't expecting anyone to use it from a phone.  I put text in columns for readability, like newspapers.  I added “page chunks” to the articles so users didn't need to scroll up and down all the time (template v4).   I added an RSS, and a site-map in that update as the content had increased.   Then 2022, I updated the HTML to a more modern version, with better accessibility (template v6).</li>
    <li>I am replacing the 2010 and 2012 era CSS with a component structured CSS design.  Cheap practice for ~30 pages with little CSS doesn't scale for &gt;300 pages which often have a lot of CSS.   As soon as layers has more support, I can put components in separate layers.  Again this change allows improving adaptability to different peoples preferences and machines.  My palette is now 9 colours, rather than erm, about 50.   I will tidyup the font declarations next.   Things would be shorter if I dropped a lot of positioning for <i>flex-grid</i></li>
    <li>I have dropped my “manual mouse hover” code (JS used for triggering adjacent elements), as CSS v4 is now widely enough supported.   In 2024 I removed all remaining shim for MSIE.</li>
    <li>In order to be semantic, the highlights are wrapped as CODE for better semantics.</li>
    <li>I am tagging older articles with a warning in the strap-line area.  I would like to add an URL map (the Apache feature) to pull in likely misspellings, and to make everything lower case</li>
    <li>It would be nice to drop the jQuery for Alpine.  I can probably make the code shorter with more modern structures.   Modern JS has more features that eliminate the need for jQuery.   The optional UX features each have a feature-flag in the root container to enable/ skip them.   Syntax highlighting in particular is much better technology than it used to be (not upgraded yet).</li>
    <li>A marketing person ~ after they have gotten over a shock about “no wordpress found” ~ will logically ask wouldn't it be faster to use a common share library e.g. <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@globocom/share-bar" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-social-share-bar" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, rather hand-rolling one.  Hopefully they then realise a JAMstack site with strong PWA doesn't really work like that.  This does help me understand those media companies API better.  </li>
    <li>After 2012, many of the articles are where I needed to be a local expert in XYZ in a hurry.  I am trying to be planned and organised about adding more content.   I have deleted 20% of my content that I do not think is useful today.</li>
    <li>You will note all the github links magically get the Octocat logo.  I also decorated the docs links.   I do not have a NPM logo to repeat the same trick.</li>
    <li>This git-repo / this project has no tests.  The engine that creates the HTML does have test-scripts, and this was the biggest test population I made at that point, as I needed to <i>test a language</i>; not an app, report or something.  They are fixtures and static expected results rather than proper unit-test with assert conditions.  My recent tweaks to the template are all tested with the next items:</li>
    <li>Currently my the directory of raw content text, which hasn't been compiled to HTML weighs abit bigger than 3MB.  I have about 260 articles, as I deleted the oldest 20% in Jan 2022.  The compiled HTML is about 5MB.  The common CSS is 110KB compiled; and the common JS is 350KB, with some pages pulling more JS.   In 2024, I assembled a better JS codebase, its now 9K on the wire.  </li>
    <li>I have moved some older JS based “UX and information retrieval improvements” to being built via CSS.  This makes the download smaller, and hopefully PageSpeed will complain about excessively large documents less often.   Unfortunately, I cannot apply the same process to mobile view, as there is no ':hover' in that render style.   I improved error reporting for remaining dead outbound-links.   </li>
    <li>Some CSS perf optimisation, no idea about impact from this.  Separately, I swapped my nice transition animated biblio tooltips to display:block ones, as <i>nobody ain't got time for</i> a 2s pageload cost on transitions.   </li>
    <li>I do not understand why many web agencies have a 1-3s page load time, after the first page impression.  They are loading vast amounts of assets via Cloudflare, which have little impact.   I do not think that random web-viewers are impressed that you installed a wordpress plugin, but they should have better market analysis than me.</li>
    <li>I am mostly adding text, and testing it using a word processor, and my language focused “glamorous assistant”. </li>
    <li> <strong> All my articles have <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-owenberesford-me-uk/nm3jtvslj7?hl=en_GB&amp;amp;form_factor=mobile" target="_blank">pagespeed</a> scores over 90, many are 100.</strong>  Google is not really supportive for longer content (based on DOM tree size).</li>
    <li>According to <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/owenberesford-me-uk/" target="_blank">websiteCarbon</a>, due to the architecture this consumes less power per page than 95% of the web.   If I leave one tree “running in the background”, I have offset 100% of the carbon made.   This doesn't count the cost-to-compile,</li>
