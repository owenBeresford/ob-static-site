<p>This is an oversized form and a technical demo / maquette.   I included a full range of HTML and CSS widgets / components to demonstrate what I can build without using any JS.   This is just a maquette, please see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/better-ux-forms#">better-ux-forms</a> for notes.   As a demo of what <em>can be done</em> via HTML+CSS, there are no useful library imports, and I needed to write all of the CSS.   Creating this framework and not completing it, means this has poor RWD and supported screen sizes.   I built the interactions on a large screen and I need to add small screen layouts.   Most of this CSS tech has been available for a while.   Items with a purple outline <i>are using JS</i>.   <br />

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Benefits: Why build this page? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>This form is equivalent to a narrow purpose app.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>This page including prose comes to 25KB, uncompressed ~ less in transit.  I haven't seen an app with less than a few meg in size. <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>The assets and JS in the page template can be ignored as they aren't used in the demo. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>This page has instant loading, admittedly on my Wifi.  When I have stopped editing it, I will benchmark this.</li>
    <li>This supports a wide range of devices, as I cautiously didn't use partially supported CSS.  It is slower and more expensive to deliver this with other tooling, although React is good for wide support.</li>
    <li>If you happen to be in a bad network area, this demo will still work (it's only 25kb).  This is easy to cache.   Heavier frameworks can't deliver around a bad network connection.   </li>
    <li>This uses *very* little CPU and battery power.  Compared to Electron apps, this article can 'fly to the moon' on the power needed to show the loading screen in Electron.  </li>
    <li>The cost to move this to another locale or culture is quite small compared to other tech options.  </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Liabilities <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Note this is primarily a form demo, I am adding in standard design elements (which I normally get from a framework).   Developing like so is very expensive, costs would be smaller if I hadn't tried to maximise the no scripting, so writing everything myself.   If scripting is used, it's best to slap the huge framework back in again, and so I show nothing.   Making a second “liteApp” from this baseline tech demo, would be a more normal cost.</li>
    <li>I didn't have a clear view on design, just interactions when I started.   I ought to redo this with better use of grids.</li>
    <li>I now have done a number of browser tests with this approach (several browsers).  For production code a second BDD / interaction test suite needs to be maintained.  This suite doesn't exist to date.</li>
    <li>Mobile CSS / Mobile-first is absent from this demo todate.   I need to add this.</li>
    <li>With this technique, I cannot add social logins / OAuth.   I also have no session at all, networking is just one HTTRPS request.   Local form-caching is decided by the browser and your settings.</li>
    <li>A more featured demo would upload any selfies to S3 or equivalent service (again JS).</li>
    <li>I need to overwork the CSS.  To do this technique now, means some CSS is specific to this [unique] form.  If I had used a targeted CSS framework for doing this, it would be much easier / faster.   The major negative about using the framework is that I need to rely on all these lesser used features being present.</li>
    <li>Until I get enough time to polish the resource, it's a rough demo.  <b>More work still needed.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>To deliver the maquette, I needed to use JS for a few details.   I was expecting to use JS for form POST, but sigh.   'Making a form' is not a thing to demo, normally.   If somehow the CSS goes missing, there is still a functioning form present, but not as nice.   If the JS goes missing, and the server can accept legacy formats, it would work.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > CSS details / Architecture: <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>In this demo z-index 3 is for notices, z-index 2 is layers, z-index 1 is for masks (currently unused).  Obviously most elements are z-index 0.   For a bigger system, I would use a larger number range;</li>
    <li>Dynamic just-CSS tab count markers.   LIMITATION: I don't seem to be able to make the total count as a CSS variable;</li>
    <li>Successfully made form help-prompts as you enter data (and only as you enter, and with no layout shifts);</li>
    <li>Without using JS, it will take a long dev-time to get support for “in this case use this date picker, in that case use that date picker”.   I spent six hours trying to chew through the problem, most versions of Safari and all of FF do not support input[type=“month”] which is best for CC forms;   </li>
    <li><del>I do not have a media query to group recent Safari and FF and not Chrome, to be able to build smart-and-clean handing on input[type=month] ~ which is absent from Safari and FF </del></li>
    <li>The screen titles need to be in the same DOM sub-tree as the screen content, so this took abit longer to layout than if they were just connected by an ID, like I would do for JS;</li>
    <li>Due to this being a tech demo (not a design demo), there is no specific support for mobile landscape layout.   I think for that layout, I would push the form screens to the right / “after” of the tabs; </li>
    <li>Decorations saying form sections have valid data (not the same as correct data, but I can't vet that);</li>
    <li>Can't use CSS content on INPUTs, so I needed to add extra SPANs;</li>
    <li>Not using accesskeys, as they don't match forms very much.   I find them harder to use in a multiple platform fashion;</li>
    <li>I need to not apply input[type=url], as I added the protocol for the user; </li>
    <li>It's not ideal that the green and blue in the screen header are about the same colour intensity.  This is bad for colour blind people. TOPO: Fix the green before adopting for real use; </li>
    <li>I dare not use the traditional inch marker (&quot;) by the shoe inputs in this as people will assume its a typo in some code;</li>
    <li>I hope that 50 chars is enough letters for a person's full name ~ <strong>TODO</strong> include more example data here;</li>
    <li>I am not using a flex layout in the tab titles, as I wanted it to be clear that the GUI Sigils were just CSS; </li>
    <li>I need a different unit for input screen sizes, as 'em' or 'rem' doesn't seem to match anything that the user enters (especially for number inputs).  Possibly this is caused by not using font size 26 as my default;</li>
    <li>If a more shiny slider is needed, then look at <sup><a href="https://css-tip.com/css-variables-range-slider/" target="_blank">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > JS is essential for: <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>LULN validation (the validation could be CSS, but that would be a hUUUUUge code volume, and an arse to test.  And there is no means to access the user input);</li>
    <li>Email validation, probably via server (i.e. talk to internet to see if the address works);</li>
    <li>URL validation, probably via server (i.e. talk to the internet to see if the address works).   I added and removed a regex to look at the URL, but as modern URLs are quite flexible, so this would be A LOT of regex;</li>
    <li>Form packing (i.e. convert to JSON and Fetch / Axios it);</li>
    <li>Support to drop files onto form to upload has to be done via JS;</li>
    <li>You can't see chosen values of SELECT via CSS, so adding JS to automate that step ;</li>
    <li>Tap to empty an INPUT field;</li>
</ul>
