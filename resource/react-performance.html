<p>This article is about React18; the approaches can be applied to other versions and frameworks, but the details only apply to that version.   Historically I try to avoid articles like this as they become dated incredibly quickly.  <i>But I brand myself as not-an-idiot.</i>   I think React is a fast framework, but I often take a different approach to other people.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Understand the architecture <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>There is a lot of data available as <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/react18-notes#">react18-notes</a>.  The following is a diagram of unidirectional dataflow.</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Improve current code <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Use NODE_ENV correctly in the build step.   I hope this is already done.   Also see `webpack --mode`.</li>
    <li>For work that you will be using for a while, make a process map of the code.  This will make it easier to see what is happening at various points.  The map should tag arrow functions vs local scope functions vs global scope functions.  Minimise function compilation on routine process, minimise data that needs to be rebuilt each time it is read eg for static data like menu options, persistently store it in a class variable.</li>
    <li>Move hosting to a CDN with correct geographic presence for your audience. </li>
    <li>Add per component tests with realistic data, and see which one is slow.  I have done this with <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/storybook#">Storybook</a>, <del>Cypress</del> and Vitest (see git).  I have failed to get this usefully done via Jest and extensions for that tool. </li>
    <li>Reduce use of <i>useEffect</i>, as it can be triggered multiple times.  It can be swapped for <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback" target="_blank">useCallback</a></i>.  Note complexity caused by references to functions, when the function is recompiled every time it is referenced ~ i.e. arrow functions <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2539205/javascript-inline-functions-vs-predefined-functions" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.   Categorically do not let inputs to one <i>useEffect</i> be the output of another <i>useEffect</i>.   An example of how not-to-use useEffect ontop of using useEffect <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64361486/react-is-slow-when-rendering-many-elements" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>For form input items, swap <i>useState</i> for <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef" target="_blank">useRef</a></i>, this means changing the input values doesn't force a redraw.</li>
    <li>Simplify waiting-for-data states by putting <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense" target="_blank">Suspense</a> into your object tree. This class has been added fairly recently, but saves time.  Add <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode" target="_blank">StrictMode</a></i> to get visibility of errors more easily.   I also see <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler" target="_blank">Profiler</a></i>, but in the context of running JS in a bigscreen webrowser, the React-browser-tool is easier to use.  If you log profiling data to a logging server for mobile, this is an option if you somehow lack normal tooling.  This component gives you <i>id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime</i> data points per render.</li>
    <li>Check HTTP headers, which should be made by the framework you are using.  Caching and compression are standard and desirable.  See also <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/commercial-website-features#">commercial-website-features</a>.</li>
    <li>Smart use of lazy loading is cunning.   Lazy loading means reducing the amount of work needed for the first render.   However when using the feature asking for the lazy load: delays occur.   If you have an app with many features (more often desktop apps), there will be many features that do not get used often; and lazy loading these components gives an easy performance benefit.    The cunning thing is making which features are lazy loaded dynamic, and matching the current users' profile.   It should be combined with <i>Suspense</i>.</li>
    <li>React works better if the data model described in the architecture image is followed.   Compared to earlier frameworks, React allows more messy development.   The app will perform better if events and data have unidirectional flow.   This somewhat vague direction can be simplified to <i>“don't get or generate the data inside the component”</i>.</li>
    <li>Add a log to your slow component <i>render()</i>, and have component run in a unit test, or isolated for 20sec.   If it has done many redraws, fix this.  If it hasn't done many redraws, you are looking at the wrong bit of code.   The easiest way to do this is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/count" target="_blank">count</a>.</li>
    <li>Add object creation logging, especially if you have non-static/ non-primitive props.  Only applies to real component classes.  See count again.  Or get the count from the running app via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakRef" target="_blank">weak references</a>.    </li>
    <li>Chrome ships with good tools for looking at React apps.   There is one recommended plugin that React will tell you about, use it to see the object graph.  However, after that, look at the performance tab in the “firebug”/chrome js debug tool.  If there is a process that is using more computation than you expected you can see it easily via here.   I haven't had good experience with <i>trace</i> output in React apps, as I either get no problem, or an unending stream of the stack, and I can't see any useful data.</li>
    <li>Improve performance by making components extend one of React.FC, React.VFC, or React.SFC, where applicable.  This tells the React engine that there should be less side-effects.</li>
</ul>


</div>
<hr />
<div class="lotsOfWords">
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Minor: Be careful around decomposition and setting props. If you are using Typescript interfaces everywhere, there should be known props, and hopefully what you wanted to set.  If you are using plain JS, that prop list may include an Axios Resultset or similar.</li>
    <li>Do not debug with <i>console.log</i> or worse <i>window.alert</i>. However ~ for temporary observation ~ only used in TEST builds, and removed by <i>eslint</i> later, these functions following may show you answers faster than running in a proper debugger. <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/time" target="_blank">time</a> and timeEnd ~ Executed as a pair, creates a timestamp easier than creating date objects each time</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table" target="_blank">table</a> ~ renders a HTML table from a object param  </li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/dir" target="_blank">dir</a>     ~ renders a tree structure from an object</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/trace" target="_blank">trace</a> ~ renders the JS stack from the place the call happened</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/warn" target="_blank">warn</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/error" target="_blank">error</a> ~ display the same message as log, but in a more attention seeking fashion.  The modern JS console understand colours; but spending time on that probably means you aren't focussed on solutions.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>As a minor concern, incautious use of icons or logos in a React component can slow it down (at a recent employer the fairly simple looking logo in a test build was rendered as 10,000 SVG nodes in the DOM).   Icons stored as SVG, but are complex shapes are better not compiled into the React element tree/ doc-fragment; as the large node count is heavy and ponderous.   The SVG graphics can be stored as a JS string and applied, which loads faster.   Icons encoded as fonts are normally fast.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Standard Ideas for new code <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Use the <i><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop" target="_blank">key</a></i> prop to all new React Components, and change the key value when any of the state changes.   The value needs to be unique, similar to a HTML id.   This allows the change detection algorithm to know if the component has changed more efficiently; so there are less redraws.   </li>
    <li>For all the values that are copied into the view aspects, store them with <i>useMemo</i> better detailed as <i><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/memoization-in-javascript-and-react/" target="_blank">memorise</a></i>.  This means there is a fixed number of copies of the data.  When the value is a mutable object this is very useful, but follow the item below on immutable data.</li>
    <li>[LONG] Create good tests for the process of getting the JS to the client.  It could be put in one large file; or many small ones.   I have seen people advocating both options.   I assert that you can use HTTP2 <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/http2" target="_blank">1</a></sup> as its after Jan 2023; and this has a set of characteristics.    Note your test Iphone on the office wifi has different network characteristics to someone moving on a train with Android (<i>pls don't drive and text, or use a phone</i>).    Having all the JS parsed in the client means a) this delay is no longer necessary  b) the user needed to wait for all that JS before they did anything.   If this app is not in testing, JS assets can be cached on the device for ages.   If this is an app where all the JS can already be installed, it will help performance; but this doesn't help the data.  Also see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/http-cache-breaker#">http-cache-breaker</a>.   Check options for static data like locales, as many libraries include many locale data assets.</li>
    <li>Work out when a structure is needed (probably with the map made above).  If it doesn't change very much it can be compiled earlier, as a Static Site Generation <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank">SSG</a> or Incremental Static Regeneration <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/" target="_blank">ISR</a>.  Try <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/next" target="_blank">nextjs</a>. </li>
    <li>As a general idea, don't create or process too many events, e.g. a search auto complete will <i>feel faster</i> if it executes every few chars, rather than per char.  Technically this is called <b>throttling</b>, and the following can be used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tadaaa" target="_blank">Tadaaa</a> (clean TS impl); <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@npm.piece/utils" target="_blank">npm.piece/utils</a> (lots of useful bits);  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-hook/throttle" target="_blank">react-hook/ throttle</a>; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-debounce-input" target="_blank">react-debounce-input</a>.    The same idea can be used to limit move or click events, with <b>debounce</b>.    </li>
    <li>List management: try to get data from the API in reasonable size bits (i.e. 1,000, not 10 items), but should apply search limits if data could go to &gt; 100,000 items. BUT don't render all the data at once, try <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window" target="_blank">react-window</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window-infinite-loader" target="_blank">react-window-infinite-loader</a>.  <i>This item sounds large and complex? Yes it is.  It took me 3 months and 5 major iterations to get a nice behaviour for a GIS search like Airbnb UI uses</i>.  Look at cache theory for best behaviour.</li>
    <li>Constant/ immutable data.  Functional architecture being a maths idea before an engineering idea doesn't use standard software engineering terms.  Simple problems are made simpler by only writing to each variable once.  See libraries <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutable" target="_blank">Immutable</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux" target="_blank">Redux</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx" target="_blank">MobX</a> and more.  This is written in a longer form <sup><a href="https://swizec.com/blog/do-you-really-need-immutable-data/" target="_blank">2</a></sup></li>
    <li>As a minor thing, I have started making utility function <i>useXXX</i> that return an instance for each component and service.  If there are specific params, or code loading order, this utility makes things easier to read and manage.   It clearly shows that the code isn't using the old module-loading <i>require</i> structure, which is important for knowing side-effects.</li>
    <li>Avoid Async code in <i>componentWillMount</i>, if needed add it to <i>componentDidMount</i>; as described <sup><a href="https://www.codementor.io/blog/react-optimization-5wiwjnf9hj#13-avoid-async-initialization-in" target="_blank">3</a></sup> </li>
    <li>Where at all possible, avoid <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync" target="_blank">flushSync</a></i>. Recent React improves event-throughput by buffering up changes, and applying them in a batch; this event handling forces everything back into small steps. </li>
    <li>Putting the computation in a separate thread/ process is a standard trick in programming.  As JS is very single threaded, do large functions in a <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-workers#">Webworker</a>, this should include talking with slow API.</li>
    <li>Some JS optimisation tips <sup><a href="https://8hob.io/posts/hidden-cost-of-literals/" target="_blank">4</a></sup></li>
    <li>Maybe be able to reduce scope of React libraries, with cunning use of <i><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal" target="_blank">createPortal</a></i> ( <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/42x771ykwx" target="_blank">demo</a> ).   I think this is not desirable for full-screen mobile apps with SPA; but for a marketing brochure site, it may improve performance, as static HTML is a lot faster than React.</li>
    <li>Larger Apps will have deep Component trees, putting your state in the nearest point to usage will speed up the app <sup><a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/in-the-weeds/my-react-app-is-slow-what-should-i-do-e1fd020e69ec" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  This is often called “state co-location”.</li>
    <li>A plugin “virtualisation” (<i>in NPMJS, pls use USA dialect spelling</i>) offers a scrolling window <sup><a href="https://nosleepjavascript.com/react-performance/#virtualization" target="_blank">7</a></sup> for data currently on screen (pun not intended).   </li>
    <li>Never use setTimeout/setInterval in React, double/ squared never use setTimeout/setInterval in the render function (its sometimes useful in test data, but that's not the same context).  There are many other options to “do work in the future”.  Adding a “do something” notification to the event queue will make it happen 1ms-500ms later, and is much better practice.   Consider the goal of waiting initially, and chose a better algorithm.   This bullet exists due to <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42089548/how-to-add-delay-in-react-js" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.</li>
