<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Intro <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>For large numbers of developers on mixed machines, it is smart to execute lint / prettier / tests / compile automatically.  For a useful amount of CI/CD <b>automation is necessary</b> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, and adding the activity in the Git service is parsimonious.</p>

<p>I didn't write this article about 10Y ago, as I thought at the time that it was very simple, and I try not to copy-and-paste the internet.   Things have migrated from a service you install and setup with YML on your laptop (like Jenkins) to a service you setup with YML on your code repo (see chart).   This makes coordination between team members easier.  I have read the included references, although for lower friction use a YML validator frequently.  The inputs for the automation services are not shown to be complex in these blogs.   I have included the official manuals in-case the blogs omitted important steps.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Local step for Git <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>Git the locally-installed tool can run scripts on “version control events” <sup><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  These are not sent to the server on Git-push, and I think make most sense for “local weirdness management”.   The first link lists the hooks that exist (about 20).   As they are running on your local device, they do not cost anything or need any SaaS accounts.<br />
This is useful if you run a different OS to the rest of the dev population, and want different line ending or char-encoding, just like the legacy FTP 'ascii mode' <sup><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/4401/whats-the-point-of-ascii-mode-in-ftp" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  <br />
<i>No code supplied, please see the first two links.</i>   I think running a list as a pre-commit is an efficiency measure if your IDE doesn't perform this.   This needs to be aligned with a no-warnings lint policy, or it is obstructive paperwork.   This policy is disruptive if abruptly applied to a existing project where dev release speed was prioritised.   Probably the smartest process is to increment the number of active lint rules over months (much longer than the average branch life span).   This means every branch may change a few details, but each step is small in time and is easy to read as a `diff`.   Assuming a steady size team of devs, there isn't likely to be a performance gain by adding `eslint` rules.  Sometimes weird compile messages can be explained via lint, but hopefully that is a rare event.   Needing to failover to the external tools manually means your IDE isn't setup properly.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if Terraform should be strictly classed as a local step.  The Terraform daemon does run locally in many cases, but for realistic service monitoring, it would be run on a server inside the production firewalls.  I made some notes <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/terraform#">terraform</a>.   This would only make changes when asked, and does support diagnostic/ review modes.   Terraform can be triggered from other services e.g. before black-friday sale begins, double server allocation on cloud host.   #TODO Add Jenkins or other locally hosted tools.</p>


<aside class="pullout">
<p>Note: with auto-deployments, the entire process needs to be automated, as you are not looking at the source code during these steps.  Yes stupid-YML-error, I'm looking at you.  I try to move analysis into lint as a mechanism to report any failures early.  For example <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitest/coverage-v8" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  Security notes on CI/CD from <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">OWASP</a>.</p>


</aside>
<p>List of tools in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control" target="_blank">Distributed version control systems</a>.   Or a better chart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities" target="_blank">Comparison of source-code-hosting facilities</a>.   Some further assorted notes that aggregate DVCS software <sup><a href="https://fullscale.io/blog/top-10-version-control-systems/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  A long list of Cloud tools and features <sup><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/feature/A-cloud-services-cheat-sheet-for-AWS-Azure-and-Google-Cloud" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Common DVCS vendors <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>This is one of the few horizontal scrolling articles on this site, but it was too hard to compare otherwise.   With the free categories, it seems good sense to run your tests locally without using the DVCS tool, this has impact of being faster.  If the tool under-dev needs to be done via a server, mocks would reduce costs, and local build scripts can be created (often exactly the same script just launched by hand).</p>

I will add more suppliers in edition 2 of this article.  #TODO IOIO I intend to add AWS Apprunner, HelixCore, AWS CodeCommit, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Gitlab, Nulab

#TODO: add a filter option to make Vendor pair comparison easier.
