<p>The mobile rings at 22:10, dissipating the quiet in the compact lounge furnished in green tones. My hands stop typing to answer the call.<br />
“Hi Merek! It’s Klara. Sorry for the late call. There’s an emergency.” Her soft-spoken voice is firm.<br />
“Good evening. How can I help?”<br />
“That sloppy web app is down again. Can you please help?”<br />
“If it’s the same problem as last week, I won’t be able to fix it remotely. I can be at yours at around noon tomorrow.”<br />
“Yes, it seems to be the same escapade as last time. Noon is perfect, thanks so much.”<br />
Once again, the problematic app written in the PHR language fell apart for Klara, plunging her into the void and the abyss. Yet again, my client is without her life bread. I admire PHR’s tenacity in failing, it never changes. No matter what version one may own of it.</p>

<p>I head off to Klara’s the next day, straight after completing the first contract work in the sunny morning. The half an hour ride on a packed train to her flat riddles my thoughts on the wider context of IT languages and their practical results to help smoothen her working environment. <br />
I aim to talk to her desktop in the TypeShift language; alas, it only understands JavaShift. I must comply. No syntactic errors arising from it.<br />
Her laptop is fluent in the obtuse C<em> language. Thankfully, so am I. Its clusters of code barricade you in forthwith without any fanfare. It’s one of those necessary evils, this C</em>. Coding paradigm warps around your digital presence and your physical absence. It turns you into a coding machine. Not the easiest language invented to talk to your machine with. Removed from the real world in a flash by its clean mathematical and functional complexity, it places you into its sole and opaque paradigm universe. Released from the senses that bind you to the present and your existence, real life becomes bewildering and impossible. You soon transform into a maladaptive being, absorbed by variables and functions you are writing, more and more remote, disconnected. Fed with unique coding sentences, line upon line.<br />
C<em> isn’t giving Klara any grief, unlike PHR. She is not even aware it’s present and running on her laptop. I don’t write in C</em> that much, and it doesn’t need constant repairing. When speaking C<em>, what does one see all day long? Walls of methodical functions typed in aligned white code, shining against a dark background. Hands and gestures turn void as you progress with your task, with hectic, robotic fingers. You hear a mouse click. Too often, too regular clicks. A keyboard being pounded, the sole acoustic reality you hear in your space. Click, type, click, type, pound, click, click. Smells and sensations vanish. Functional sentences captivate your mind to the furthest limit, leading you to the peak of the equation. Your present blurs into a variable you’re populating, a syntax you are writing. You master the language through its code as the database takes over your world, moulding into your reality. Ah, that C</em>.<br />
And then… Then there’s PHR. Its view and voice dominate the digital path from your electronic terrace. This polluting language lacks articulation and elegance. It’s a suboptimal resource, propagating itself across our numerical planet. How did it develop into being the primary language for such a critical aspect of one’s online person? <br />
Klara is the breathing assertion of it: PHR fails her about five times a month. My contracting role, fixing the faulty PHR bugs, is lucrative. Because they’re unfixable. Flawed functions. Any app today ought to run on a more elaborate and robust code, with machines talking to each other seamlessly within their environment. Don’t even get me started on its semantics and libraries. The streamlined error generator. One might baptise this dwarf language as an ecological defect. <br />
The tools the eco-unfriendly PHR uses? A stack of random instruments dropped into a large metal bin. Shove those tools in a blender: this is PHR. Sound variables crushed in a high voltage mixer. They spill out a gooey, opaque, and fractal substance. Open any recent article on PHR, the quantity of written analysis lambasting it will overwhelm your mind. No need for me to elaborate on anything further, ever. One can’t whack around this PHR nonsense any longer. A broken language, with no eco-friendly verbs, even less clean sentences to work with.<br />
I resolutely put my hands in the beige coat pockets as I sprint toward her flat. Bubbles of innovative ideas germinate and envelop a new goal. When aiming for clean usage, why not spread wider the newer and non-polluting HTMT language instead? Any web app today should speak in HTMT, an optimal structural language. A promise of a greener tech future.</p>

<p>Klara opens the burgundy door in a swift movement. Her exasperated tanned face smiles in relief. I know the layout of her spacious and bright flat too well. She runs her freelance business from her tastefully decorated living room filled with magazines and books that form her translating helpmates within physical reach. There are a lot more of those aides installed on her machines. She makes a space on the versatile table and adjusts two high seats.<br />
“Today, Klara, I would like to implement a new web app, a more robust tool for your professional usage.” I explain to her as I sit down at her computer. “I would suggest I install for you the latest version of HTMT. This new scenario will lavishly optimise your business.”<br />
“Merek, new app installations generate new errors. At least with the current app, you know the issues and how to solve them. The error message that sprung at me yesterday was, just like last time, in Israeli instead of English. I giggled when I saw that again. I needed a chuckle after all my transactions ground to a standstill. Madness, isn’t it?” Klara waves her fraught hand in front of the widescreen monitor.<br />
I turn my head from the screen and gaze at her. Anything but PHR, forsooth, please, I plead. I can’t fix those irrevocable PHR errors. It won’t sustain through me, even if it means losing a client. <br />
“Granted, there are no flawless IT languages. I’ve been fixing your app issues for far too long, and, as you’re aware, this is impacting your business.”<br />
“The current app in there isn’t HTMT?”<br />
“No, it isn’t. That unreliable app belongs to PHR, an outdated web language that is prone to constant errors. Pretend PHR is a person. It runs on dodgy knee-caps, wobbly knees, and awkward heels. Shoes don’t fit. It calls in sick a lot. It is easy to hack. I propose to apply to your landscape HTMT, the most resilient of web languages to date. It won’t fail you in such a massive proportion. Do you want stuff to work in a more stable fashion?”<br />
“I do, of course. Hmm, I see your point.” Klara replies. Her chestnut eyes drift to gape through the window, regaining her calmness. “How many of your clients have the same issues I have with this?”<br />
“Too many, to be honest. I gradually offer everyone without exception to upgrade their systems to HTMT, a plan worth fulfilling, as it accommodates all your needs. A much better outcome. I should have suggested this to you earlier.”<br />
“Why haven’t you recommended that before?” she stares at me, reflecting on the new option.<br />
 She might not need my services so often again if I install the new language on to her machine today. She might not need me at all. When aiming for robust coding elegance, HTMT is the one. All for a better green web browsing future. It holds exponential value in the long run, for her and for the communicating digital planet. <br />
Set the elegant HTMT code into the digital structure, and with Klara’s approval, hit return.</p>
