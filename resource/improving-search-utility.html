<p>In this text, I use the metaphor of UK educational level.   An average person may have:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>GSCEs: Are compulsory education, paid for by taxes.   Most of the population has these at 16YO, and they mean little after you are 17Y+ <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infographic-gcse-results-2021/infographics-for-gcses-2021-accesible" target="_blank">1</a></sup></li>
    <li>A-level [and equiv]: there are many flavours of education for 16YO-18YO.   These are recommended as more detailed training in a smaller range of subjects, and are achieved by a fairly high percent of the population.   Still paid for from taxes  <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infographic-a-level-results-2022/infographics-for-a-level-results-2022-accessible" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>BSc: This is an internationally understood qualification, I hope they are all similar.   This is a three year study in a single area (with possible sandwich year), and the area is likely to be more tightly defined than lower levels of grading.   Currently in the UK degrees are paid for by students; or possibly the employer in the case of more vocational ones  <sup><a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/education-and-training-statistics-for-the-uk/2020" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   For non-STEM subjects, it will have a different abbreviation.</li>
    <li>MSc: A initially higher degree, normally lasting 1Y,but may have extra sandwiches.   Paid for by student; or possibly the employer in the case of more vocational ones <sup><a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/18-04-2023/ah2304-degree-attainment-socioeconomic-background" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  Again for non-STEM subjects, this will have a different abbreviation.</li>
    <li>PhD: aka Doctorate.   Highest single certificate.   An extra time of study, no fixed duration.   To achieve a doctorate, the student is supposed to demonstrate a new thing that has not been seen before.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like this scale, as a fairly standardized method for “how difficult is this?&quot;, for example:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>sample GCSE level: sort this list [...]</li>
    <li>sample PhD level: invent a new search algo, that is faster than the current ones</li>
</ul>

<p>For a population of people looking information up on the internet the following query ratios are likely to apply:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>1000</b> GCSE complexity queries for simple information (e.g. “when is tax due?&quot;, “do I pay UK VAT on French fags?&quot; )<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>There are many sites that can answer questions like this, SEO is quite crowded.  Note: Not all responses are the same quality.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>100</b>  A-level complexity queries (e.g. “Is it cheaper to give my teen an education fund, or pay their student loan?&quot; or “Xero new features” ) <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>There are many sites that can answer questions like this, but hopefully longer words and less slogany.  Note: Not all responses are the same quality.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>20</b>   BSc  queries for “average tax declaration resubmission rate” or “example 'further data' form to reduce HMRC attention”<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>The answer to this query will exist, and will get out of date.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>1</b>    PhD query for “UK tax 2021 combine benefits from carbon reduction and selling art”<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Rare, difficult, and very specific.  According to theory you need to be a PhD level thinker to write these.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I choose tax as an example data as tax is factual, slow to change (compared to general finance or politics), has broad scope, and lots of people need to be correct about it.</p>

<p>Google and related people call the more difficult end of the market the “long tail keywords”, referencing a Stats bell-curve probability distribution.   <i>My scheme states how hard the problem is, rather than how rare it is.</i>   There are some well advertised challenges to solve a particular hard engineering problem, which I assume have many entrants; but the problem remains hard.  For example <a href="https://worldsolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank">driving across Australia only using solar power</a>.  See <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Solar_Challenge" target="_blank">5</a></sup> for just factual data.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Search and information spaces for retail <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>For a person with a site, there is a lot of SEO tooling to support the GCSE end of the market, as that will get a larger number of impressions.   This will affect your Google ranking positively, which is desirable.   Some marketing people model that consumers start by searching for vague data; then get more specific, as the consumer learns more about the situation.  For some artefacts which are practical to buy with low levels of knowledge about the product, these vague queries are useful, and can lead to success for the consumer and retailer.  This is retail e.g. buying a DVD disk as a present; and having a website that in SEO terms is very loud and clear about 'DVDs for sale' will make revenue for the owner.  This is where most SEO activity focusses, and I guess where most profit is made.<br />
The professional 'SEO engineers' state that there is better income from targeting the simple and common questions.   This is definitely true if you sell advertising as your revenue stream.   I suppose if your content was scrapped from another site (with or without licensing it), there would be a “effort curve” encouraging less effort content, large numbers of random views not highly committed readers.  <br />
It should be noted that the simple end of the information space is frequently crowded with many sites.  Often answering the query is a means to-do a different thing, e.g. a page offering details about batteries on a site that sells them.   As a consequence of the first sentence, the market has organised towards larger networks, and strongly displays “network effects” (did you “google it” or “search engine for it”).  This is where a strong brand will dominate the information space, and effectively control it, as all competitors need to play inside the first brands process to be heard.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Search and information spaces for expert buyers  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>There are many businesses that are profitable because they solve a particular MSc or PhD grade query, and have data about it highly visible on their sales funnel website.   Example: I previously worked for a fintech startup that was founded by a watch manufacturer.  His separate watch business only sold luxury watches that he made, and that started at £500 and got more features like gold fittings for more money.  His SEO was very targeted at high-end buyers, who use luxury watches to display wealth and sophistication.   Even if he made a few non-bounced and non-search-crawler user-impressions per day, he was likely to make a healthy profit.  <br />
When a user asks a PhD or MSc rarity query, they are an informed user, who is probably motivated to achieve that goal.   For things that are products, the asker is likely to accept spending more money per SKU as its a rare and hard solution that they are attempting to buy.   Secondly, as a rare / small market product, there is no economy of scale, and it will need to be pricey.   If exclusive luxury was cheap it wouldn't be exclusive or luxurious.</p>

<p>ERRATA: My site would do better, if it had a good placement on a list of long tail keywords.</p>
