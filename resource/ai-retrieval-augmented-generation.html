<p>Context: Here RAG is not red-amber-green, as used in strict TDD <sup><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" target="_blank">1</a></sup> .  Or any of the definitions in <a href="https://www.acronymfinder.com/RAG.html" target="_blank">acronym finder</a>.   I am fitting current hype on LLM tech into an automated decision-making continuity and applying standard engineering processes to LLM.   Everyone selling LLM products needs to have these processes in place.   Over Xmas 2023, I saw a LLM made entirely in Postgres commands [XXX #leSigh], hype and peta-scale data isn't needed, although the peta data allows a more general set of responses.   This article is not very end-user focused, I am focusing on algorithms, and how to build solutions.</p>

<p>This domain is obviously full of AI, and the temptation for <i>“people who know”</i> how to use AI so they don't need to leave their professional context when efficiently writing articles for <i>“people who don't”</i> would be high, and also demo their work.  The fact that some of the papers I am reading don't seem to have been even proofread increases this impression.  Note that terms used in RAG are also used in other technical areas, they are just english phrases (not for AI).<br />
Earlier used “computer-based decision making” algorithms include Logic based AI <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@codeavail/introduction-to-prolog-a-programming-language-for-ai-3b4b134d06d8" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, Expert systems <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, deep learning neural networks <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/learn" target="_blank">6</a></sup> and ML <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.  It should be noted here and often that the LLM algorithm <i>doesn't know</i> anything, which is a big contrast to earlier logic and expert system solutions which <i>knew</i> a lot on a very narrow subject.  Off topic reading on logic based AI <sup><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/sum2020/entries/logic-ai/index.html" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/myteaching/logic-based-learning/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-1567-8_1" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   A ML system <i>knows</i> its training data (and assuming <i>smart humans</i> have supplied good training data), this allows it to make useful statements about the actual world <sup><a href="https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/accuracy-precision-recall" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The phrase RAG, “Retrieval-augmented generation”, means data to improve an LLM's answer <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@pankaj_pandey/unleash-the-power-of-rag-in-python-a-simple-guide-6f59590a82c3" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   The process was first described in <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401" target="_blank">4</a></sup>,  The first link states that RAG can be used to update the answers from an LLM with newer information.   An LLM supplies a probabilistic guess on what <i>an</i> answer looks like, hopefully a good answer.   A RAG can also be used for re-ranking the results from the LLM <sup><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/boost-llm-accuracy-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-reranking" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, so the results returned first are best.   The initial LLM result is likely to lack context as the LLM is reporting stored data, the RAG of the users context improves results.   The link lists types of re-rankers.   A high level summary compares RAG to an open book exam <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-from-theory-to-langchain-implementation-4e9bd5f6a4f2" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.   <br />
According to <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13296v1" target="_blank">7</a></sup> ~ jump to 1.9 ~ <sup><a href="https://thenewstack.io/how-large-language-models-fuel-the-rise-of-vector-databases/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> a use of RAG to moderate the input, and only use a LLM for text generation.  It cites that the RAG can be used (before the LLM) to improve domain knowledge and add more context so the LLM is less likely to create valueless answers.  The reference is large and valuable to read.</p>

<div class="lotsOfWords">
<p>For a large scale contextual match, it is more efficient to convert the human prompt into a “vector”, or as an optimisation of large samples into an “embedding” <sup><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.   This allows efficient transmission of LLM working memory or “conversation knowledge” to local storage or over the network to the LLM server.  However, for smaller data sets, RAG can use a traditional DB <sup><a href="https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-what-does-it-do-for-generative-ai/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, or just search tech (I suspect this needs API access rather than full HTML+JS bells ands whistles).   <br />
Vectors are floats (different to 3d graphics) - used here.   <br />
The process to convert a sentence to a couple of numbers is complicated, tightly dialect-specific, and probably off-topic for this article, some notes on this <sup><a href="https://wikipedia2vec.github.io/wikipedia2vec/intro/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  A review of several “vectoring algorithms” from the perspective of data science <sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9750790" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.   My brief reading hasn't determined if vectors from different code libraries can be mixed.   There are a couple of “how distant is this word to that word” algorithms, some simple ones are discussed in <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@stepkurniawan/comparing-similarity-searches-distance-metrics-in-vector-stores-rag-model-f0b3f7532d6f" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.   Output of different NLP libraries ~ as defined <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" target="_blank">6</a></sup> ~ cannot be merged (just using lang=en, and recent Python).   <br />
Apparently Vector stores are not the same thing as DB (without fiddling with storeproc), as they are described as unstructured heaps <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@mutahar789/optimizing-rag-a-guide-to-choosing-the-right-vector-database-480f71a33139" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.   If your data is an unstructured heap then a traditional SQL DB is not an adjacent idea.  Each typical user journey seems to match best with a different store (same link).   I do not have data on how many floats in <i>answer / content X</i> need to match <i>query Y</i> need to match to make a useful response, but probably more than one. <br />
<strong>UPDATE</strong> ~ According to <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13296v1#bib.bib22" target="_blank">8</a></sup> people sometimes translate their current samples into another human language, then back again to “create more samples”.  As far as this is the same amount of information, I don't see how this is valuable.  If the LLM can't generate the content, using other language skills from other bits of text, it's not generating in a meaningful fashion.   <br />
The fastText algorithm made by FAIR (part of Facebook inc) <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastText" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText" target="_blank">git</a> hugging-face <sup><a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.reachsumit.com/posts/2020/07/spell-checker-fasttext/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> is an algorithm to convert a string into Vectors.  This was published in 2017 as <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Value proposition <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Nearly all recent features or products using an LLM need to include RAG (or similar algorithms) as it reduces occurrences of hallucinations, and it allows visibility on original data source so improving trust in the response <sup><a href="https://www.k2view.com/blog/rag-hallucination/#AI-Hallucination-vs-RAG-Hallucination" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.   This algorithm reflects academic practice in Europe since 800CE (biblio / references / reading lists).  Some published papers state that training an LLM on data including LLM output leads to generation quality collapse <sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y" target="_blank">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493" target="_blank">15</a></sup> ~ both links are the same work.   Midpoint is the name of an AI image generator, and the response an LLM creates is a most highly likely mid-point. <br />
The features that are most often built with LLM+RAG seem to be <strong>chatbots</strong>.   AI retailers are selling the dream of less staff to respond to customers and potential new customers as a business plan.   For some things, conversational UI are more useful for humans, especially doing low commitment activities ~ eg “Mobile, guess the weather tomorrow”.   It's odd that Siri ~ created and sold by Apple ~ that has existed for quite a few years, is a voice prompt for this effect <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" target="_blank">16</a></sup>, but not included in the general AI hype.   <br />
A nice article describing risk areas and mitigation strategies whilst using ML <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/machine-learning-a-practical-guide-to-managing-risk-52624cf03f3a" target="_blank">17</a></sup>, I would suggest that a similar process is used for LLM+RAG. <br />
Other terms graphRAG, vectorRAG, hybridRAG</p>
