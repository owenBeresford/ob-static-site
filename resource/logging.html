<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Why add logging? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Most importantly for some activities, logging is a legal requirement, or an accounting or business requirement.  In these cases it will be in the requirements.</p>

<p>Unless you are leaning over the shoulder of every user of your software, you do not know what they are doing.  Logging is another way to see their actions.  Profiles of your users are sometimes a valuable corporate asset (e.g. selling advertising space when you know you have a lot of users).  Assuming the development team is responsible for service availability; knowledge of and quick response to any problems is highly useful.<br />
High granularity low-level Logging is most meaningful in complex code with decision making.  I mostly write this style of logging for service daemons, who are more likely to be doing bigger operations.  These daemons may be written in a compiled language, and there is no local copy of the source code.   Where code strongly depends on third parties so is low complexity ~ maybe very valuable ~ it often doesn't gain from logging.   <br />
During testing, knowledge of point of failure before segfaults is really useful.   Yes, these do happen in higher-level “no pointers” languages.   Secondly, on larger systems a regular log markers can inform about execution time and bottle necks.   These should be disabled in production.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Why suppress / hide logging ? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>The automated reporting of minor lint type notices is of little value, at runtime.  For development builds this is useful, but no later in a products lifespan.   Likewise logging on any scalable server code needs to be lean and buffered to avoid locking to the server with disk writes.  Logging to a DB can scale up this ability, and is much easier to search/report against.<br />
Writing stateful software reduces the need for logging, and provides a list of other benefits.  Stateless logging is fundamentally useless in retrospective review, e.g. a message of “Order placed” is stateless; but “Order for 4 royal-blue armchairs, delivery date 12/12/2016” is stateful.  Stateless logging can be useful for the developer watching a test build directly; but this is better done in unit tests, so again is not a solution.  Thirdly logging is needed most when the code is poorly structured.   Reasonable code structure reduces the need for it, as well as many other benefits.<br />
As a general statement, if the logging output is a lot of data and no information; then it is not meeting comms requirements or being a solution.  In this case it's useless.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > How to add logging <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>You are likely to be using a framework, it is likely to have a log facility.  As such you don't need to create this technical feature.  Learn how to manage this, and ensure it is disabled on production. <br />
Where logging is an objective, obviously create the logging.  A normal pattern for transaction systems is to log each state change for the transactions.  This is normally described as an Event log.  This is normally held in a transaction data-store, as part of business documentation/ process (and isn't a technical item).<br />
As your code should be reasonably structured, so a few bits of logging are all that is needed for the happy path.   All exception cases that require a human interaction must be documented (in the log), or the resolve cannot be applied.  Exception cases that represent a data-point in a larger scenario should be logged (e.g. on the last working day of the month the entire e-commerce reports slow SQL warnings, being induced by the billing cycle audits also being performed and blocking systems).<br />
Logging as a low level process is fairly low business utility.  This type of logging should be created in a fashion that is cheap to apply (e.g. a text macro in your IDE), with things like code-location being generated automatically (for example in PHP the _ _ METHOD _ _ and _ _ LINE _ _ macros are quite useful).  It is quite useful if it can be globally turned on/off (a test against load time defined constant for example).  UPDATE: more recently I have been removing this from production builds as a compile step.  <br />
Logging as a record of user actions, including timing and user id, is a valuable business asset.  This can be done to a reasonable granularity with a third party analytics platform (e.g. Google analytics) on open-web accessible systems.</p>

<p>Addendum: some larger organisations have fiddled with the definition of “logging”, they are thinking ELK, or Splunk stacks (etc many options), and do not use anything like a local syslog.   For this Enterprise logging, they have analytics and reporting tools builtin and pre-scaled I/O process.   This event log is to show business events, not code execution.   It is suggested to have one Event-happened entry per business operation, and supply a rich context to it.   If necessary the single log event could be composed during a sequence of checkpoints, then flushed like a SQL transaction.   This composite log event applies to code that is fairly long and uses few external services.</p>
