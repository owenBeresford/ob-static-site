<p>To get an image on website is trivial. To get an important image to meet some metric (frequently performance/ page render speed) is more work.  The article title is trying to be vague about technology/implementation, as the requirements shouldn't predetermine the outcome. <i>I am capitalising HTML tags, to make it more readable, I know its lowercase in HTML5.</i></p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Image architectures <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can display a picture inside a browser via:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>An IMG tag</li>
    <li><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/html5-img#">PICTURE</a> tag, RWD version of previous</li>
    <li>The OBJECT tag</li>
    <li>CSS background-image</li>
    <li>Symbol fonts, and the relevant 'letter'</li>
    <li>An inline image with SVG (so the image data is literally part of the HTML)</li>
    <li>Most expensively, with “CSS + div drawing” (I have only seen this a few times, as a portfolio piece)</li>
    <li>Download as attachment for large images </li>
</ul>

<p>With 2020 technology, what is the fastest?<br />
For this article, assume the picture is a line drawing, rather than video, or a photo.  Secondly this is for static graphics.  Thirdly, this is not applicable to email.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Basic optimisation steps <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>[To me, this section is old material, and entirely boring]</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>PNG palette size; when PNG is best, use pngcrush <sup><a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/pngcrush.1.html" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/Kjuly/pngcrush" target="_blank">2</a></sup> or optipng <sup><a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/optipng.1.html" target="_blank">3</a></sup> etc to reduce the palette to the colours you are using.</li>
    <li>PNG image scaling <sup><a href="https://resizeimage.net/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling" target="_blank">general algorithms</a> <sup><a href="https://www.abetterlemonadestand.com/optimizing-images-for-web/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://a-sharper-scaling.findmysoft.com/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> (http only)   </li>
    <li>If using SVG, pls see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/svg-optimisation#">SVG optmisation</a></li>
    <li>If you inline images into the HTML, you can avoid extra HTTP requests (<i>in June 2020, my site is doing this with the favico as an experiment; I will probably go back to a separate file after June</i>).  If there is any media filtering (e.g. the viewer is a search engine); this won't behave as expected.  </li>
    <li>With non-text picture formats, it is possible to inline things, as you can have a dataurl <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs" target="_blank">8</a></sup> and use base64 <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">10</a></sup>; however you start paying with increased data bandwidth (+33% volume) instead of increased HTTP requests.</li>
    <li>With a Picture element, you can send images to fit reported screen-size (obviously a 2000px wide image doesn't work well with a cheap low-res 'driod device)</li>
    <li>Use a CDN, so data can get to your client faster; if the client isn't in the same country as your server.</li>
    <li>Services like <sup><a href="https://giphy.com/search/sample/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> which allow some movement at fairly low res, see docs <sup><a href="https://developers.giphy.com/docs/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> </li>
    <li>Disable any image scaling; if the image is too large, use option2</li>
</ul>

<p><aside class="pullout">
<p>Aside: IMG are best for accessibility as every tool knows how to access them.  How can you add a tooltip/ alt text to a background-image?  Or the aria-hidden meta data for “ignore me”.<br />
PICTURE elements support title, and aria items but not alt attrib (although a inner IMG for MSIE support would do).</p>


</aside></p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Literature Survey <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><strong>I need to restructure this data, its currently just a brain dump</strong></li>
    <li>Geographic proximity has a large impact on all network operations.  Many people use CDN to be nearer their clients (yes this point is twice, as it is very significant). Reference: In my current role, page render time is doubled when I am using an NY based server, rather than one I can jog to in LDN.  This is with the identical codebase, and sufficient server resources that server contention isn't an issue.</li>
    <li>Obviously the mechanics of putting an image on screen aren't affected by which code invoked it.  The mechanism does affect when the process is started, and the DOM paint order.   I pulled some notes <sup><a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969" target="_blank">14</a></sup>. This is focussed on JS rendering, so is abit tangential <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.   As a resource focussed on tools in Chrome try <sup><a href="https://varvy.com/pagespeed/display.html" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://web.dev/lighthouse-performance/" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Applying media attributes to CSS assets <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-blocking-css" target="_blank">18</a></sup> will allow the browser to do less work, which is faster.  Likewise marking optional JS (optional for first page render) as “defer” <sup><a href="https://javascript.info/script-async-defer" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10808109/script-tag-async-defer" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.  Thirdly performance can be increased by avoiding unnecessary paints, detailed in <sup><a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/unnecessary-paints/" target="_blank">21</a></sup></li>
    <li>Notes on analysis of network performance, for mobile in 2013 <sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IRHyU7_crIiCjl0Gvue0WY3eY_eYvFQvSfwQouW9368/edit#slide=id.gc57996a9_12_0" target="_blank">22</a></sup> (listed for background, otherwise skip this link).</li>
    <li>A person on twitter announced AVIF format <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF" target="_blank">23</a></sup> for still images.  Technically it is a borrowed feature from a video format; but it supplies better looking results where supported.  It can't be used on anything by Apple, or Edge <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/avif" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.   In the demo on <sup><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/" target="_blank">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/image-optimisation-with-next-gen-image-formats-webp-and-avif-248c75afacc4" target="_blank">26</a></sup> the image files are smaller than other formats; so should lead to a faster/smoother experience.</li>
</ul>


</div>
<hr />
<div class="lotsOfWords">
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>WRT PNG, the technical term for 'shrink palette' is 'where possible use “PNG-8”'.  It is stated to prefer to use pngquant <sup><a href="https://www.ostechnix.com/pngquant-a-command-line-utility-to-compress-png-images-on-linux/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> for this, as it handles transparencies in a more useful fashion than ImageMagick <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14032098/2375161" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1468221/can-you-force-imagemagick-to-use-png-8-alpha-transparency" target="_blank">3</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>Common knowledge: DO NOT overwrite the same JPEG (or other lossy formats) image continuously, as it is a lossy format, and will store slightly less quality data each time you hit save.  A management strategy is to keep a untouched master copy in TIFF, or camera RAW formats (if you do this, keep a change log, so you can easily build the result image again). </li>
    <li>Common again: If printing is an important user story; you need to be using IMG or PICTURE, as most “prepare to print” processes strip random backgrounds (as a plain white background is much better on paper).</li>
    <li>Also fairly common knowledge, reduce cookies used with the transmission images.  They slowdown the request, which is via slower upload channel; but are unlikely to be used for the image. </li>
    <li>Not specifically to do with images; but trimming unused sections from fonts/ libraries can speedup image loading, as there is less contention.</li>
    <li>I saw today on twitter, a proposal for CSS ruleset “prefers-reduced-data” <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2370" target="_blank">5</a></sup> current discussion <sup><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/oNJTem41LBs/CA4Nx05aAwAJ" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.   This would allow people who know they have slow bandwidth to get a better performing app.</li>
    <li>To extend the previous item, in JS there is `navigator.connection` <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection" target="_blank">7</a></sup> in Chrome (and FF when enabled); which supplies some readonly data about client internet connection speed.  I'm not sure <i>practically</i> this is any use (by the time you have downloaded JS, parsed JS, and executed it; its abit late to check line-speed).</li>
    <li>A really big/detailed SVG may be affected by a “paint-order” attribute <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/paint-order" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, but I have never made an image that complex.</li>
    <li>PNG render time can be made less obstructive with interlacing <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlacing_%28bitmaps%29" target="_blank">9</a></sup> (may increase size) <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13449314/when-to-interlace-an-image" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/574/progressive-jpeg-why-do-many-web-sites-avoid-rendering-jpegs-that-way-pros" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.  Interlacing is good when you have many viewers/ customers in areas of less stable infrastructure ~ “the third world”; as there it will still take a time to download images. </li>
    <li>It is important to use a correct size image for small screen devices (i.e. phones); but in realistic situations, interlacing is useful on phones (not so much impact on DSL lines).  This is less conspicuous with 4g than 3g; however “realistic 4g” isn't the same level of service that you saw in the showroom.</li>
    <li>JPEG render time be reduced by using newer versions of JPEG (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR).  I don't use many photos in my boring B2B work, also this article is about line drawings <sup><a href="https://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-jpeg-and-jpeg2000" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.verypdf.com/pdfinfoeditor/jpeg-jpeg-2000-comparison.htm" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.opticallimits.com/jpeg2000-vs-jpeg-vs-tiff" target="_blank">14</a></sup>. The second link is quite detailed.  Notes on JXR (shortened form of 'jpeg xr', that seems common on the internet) <sup><a href="https://jpeg.org/jpegxr/" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/compression/jpeg-xr" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.philipstorry.net/thoughts/bpg-vs-jpeg-vs-webp-vs-jpeg-xr" target="_blank">17</a></sup> show that is it useless (MSIE only), and should be ignored.</li>
    <li>If you need to use JPEG, Mozilla published mozjpeg <sup><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/08/using-mozjpeg-to-create-efficient-jpegs/" target="_blank">18</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2014-03-mozilla-jpeg-compression-mozjpeg-tool.html" target="_blank">19</a></sup>, which will give you a better JPEG file.</li>
    <li>Encode images in WEBP format <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq" target="_blank">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp" target="_blank">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://insanelab.com/blog/web-development/webp-web-design-vs-jpeg-gif-png/" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/jpg-vs-webp/" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.keycdn.com/support/jpg-to-webp" target="_blank">24</a></sup> caniuse: <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=webp" target="_blank">25</a></sup></li>
    <li>SVG rendering can be improved alot (by editing) when you are using an SVG image that was converted from another format. The SVG on <sup><a href="https://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">26</a></sup> are a good example of this.  The vector drawing doesn't look as good, and is slow.</li>
    <li>Fonts haven't been mentioned so far; the control mechanisms “link rel” attribute for using them are discussed <sup><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-fonts-in-2018-f191a48367e8/" target="_blank">27</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance" target="_blank">28</a></sup>.  Updated ~ 2020 ~ technology on what fonts formats to use is in <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/web-font-2020#">web-font-2020</a>, and <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/web-font-2024#">web-font-2024</a>.  Note the first two links are using JS to load fonts, which would be slower.  I would definitely host the font files on your own server that is fairly near your userbase physically, its not much hassle to set a mime header; but avoiding all the middle people is a noticeable performance gain.</li>
    <li>Obviously for users who notice bandwidth effects, ensuring your font files support the relevant section of UTF-8, and only that section of glyphs will reduce the download size; and therefore increase speed; secondly “big widely usable fonts” encode a variety of font glyph weights, if you only include the weights you are using, this will again reduce download volume.   You need some type of font editor to do this.</li>
    <li>Article on measuring font downloading performance <sup><a href="https://www.igvita.com/2014/01/31/optimizing-web-font-rendering-performance/" target="_blank">29</a></sup>. This article also supplies ways to get the fonts on screen faster, by rearranging content; but I think they would just slow down everything that isn't a font.</li>
    <li>Some browsers process 'text-rendering' CSS hint; to encourage a browser to be a fast renderer, or to more readable <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-rendering" target="_blank">30</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Just as a counter note, some people may block fonts <sup><a href="https://collinmbarrett.com/block-web-fonts/" target="_blank">31</a></sup> for security and performance reasons.  Remember to degrade gracefully. </li>
</ul>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Conclusion <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>I need to build some of these, to look at the performance; and what the images look like with compression.</li>
    <li>IMO, a font renderer library will be very optimised, so if we can trick using this to draw images we should have faster results.   Extra test here.</li>
    <li>I, on the odd occasion display a photo; and will keep using PICTURE tag to support a range of screen sizes.</li>
    <li>I, on the odd occasion display a photo; and will attempt using WEBP format.</li>
    <li>I more often render a graph, or display a diagram; and will keep using SVG.</li>
    <li>When I need to display a corporate logo (not my employer) will try to use a symbol font</li>
    <li>When I need to display my employers logo, <del>I will try to gouge a budget to get the <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/web-font-2020#"> logo into the symbol font</a> because I think its cool, but maybe over-engineering.</del><ins>UPDATE 2021: I have way to do this at affordable cost, pls see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/symbol-tools#">symbol-tools</a> </ins></li>
    <li>When I need to render an image in a generated PDF, I don't expect to be able to use SVG; I will have to fail over to PNG or TIFF.  For work, negotiate with the person making assets to get all the formats.</li>
    <li>When I need to render an image in an email, I will attach the image to the email and use JPEG or PNG (because a lot of people use outlook).</li>
