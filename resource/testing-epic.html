    <li>It enables you to charge more per hour, as your work is better quality;</li>
    <li>Using TDD enables your timescales to be meaningful (so can charge more);</li>
    <li>Using BDD enables more confidence that your solution matches the requirements (so can charge more);</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Project managers, you like tests because <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Tests reduce risk, so you have more control;</li>
    <li>TDD means all data needed for the solution is known at the start, so you have more confidence in being able to deliver;</li>
    <li>BDD and TDD reduce the amount of rework needed, so timescales are more secure;</li>
    <li>I think TDD reduces costs (mostly the last point), so the TCO is much smaller;</li>
    <li>Testing allows revenue generation faster, as the solution is in a reliable state faster;</li>
    <li>To be equal with motivation, the above points mean you can charge more;</li>
</ul>

<p>In analogy, compare software purchase to shoes:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>If you live in a world where you don't need shoes, I have nothing to offer you (i.e. bar staff won't hire developers);</li>
    <li>You can buy a pair of shoes frequently (i.e. less good code, less reliable deadlines), or a decent pair that lasts longer (software engineering process).  If I run in plimsoles, I need to replace them after about 5mi, which is often 1days distance.  Managing shoe supply on that frequency is very demanding.  I don't like being constrained to walking, to save the shoes;</li>
    <li>For alot of things, it is more common sense to use a highstreet shoe than a custom handmade pair (good developers will use frameworks and common libraries, then your custom bits);</li>
    <li>Due to the special nature of software; clever well-made shoes ~ for example DocMartin ~ don't go out of fashion (e.g. CMS features, so your software says your marketing current story);   </li>
    <li>When buying, economies of scale make a large impact on price (i.e. buying a pair of Brand X from a big city outlet will cost less than the same Brand X shoe in a 'boutique shop' in a small town).  Against software engineering, hiring the right person from the start is cheaper;</li>
    <li>When applying these techniques, you can get revenue earlier, more reliably/consistently and at lower risk;</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > What are unit tests? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>A unit test is the process of checking results for a given input; on every method in the project you are building.  This helps isolate failures, and the systematic approach to the tests provides a more systematic code quality.   </li>
    <li>The basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Wiki article</a>, <a href="https://artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test/" target="_blank">the artoftesting</a> or <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/unit-testing" target="_blank">techtarget</a>.  My <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/unit-tests#">unit-tests</a> article is a longer version on this paragraph.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > What is TDD? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>TDD is the process of verifying your intentions at the cheapest point (first), by writing lots of unit tests.  By focussing on deliverables first and making an executable specification; then doing a second leg to tidyup and improve code quality; one is often faster.</li>
    <li>Is is a contraction of <i>test-driven development</i>.</li>
    <li>For the formal definition, please read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-drive:wqn_development" target="_blank">wiki</a>. </li>
    <li>For some other <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213741/dead-simple-introduction-to-tdd-test-driven-development" target="_blank">notes</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3246106/explain-tdd-in-simple-terms" target="_blank">more</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2323613/what-are-good-online-introductions-to-testing-and-test-driven-development" target="_blank">so on</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Most people's practical-usage of TDD does not have tests for “compile errors”, which are really easy to observe and will block testing, deployment and in some cases writing code, as the IDE evaluates the current code all the time.  Thus the classic blog article “feature” where you run an initial test and discover a compiler error is pointless.  To deliver the TDD spec, run the tests with all files present, all dependencies installed, all functions declared, but not function bodies.  In some cases that last line needs adjusting as function declarations without return statements are still compile problems.  Thus you test the unit-test against your spec.<br />
I do not have a current good process to test “have I installed the best option for dependencies”, mostly focussing on versions of fast moving JS libraries.  Remember that latest version may have a BC, so <i>latest != best</i> in some cases.   This is a time consuming chore.</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc5"> <a href="#toc5" title="Jump to this section." > What is BDD? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>BDD is extending the ideas of TDD; to reduce the risk of miscommunication between the stakeholders and the developers, add an executable specification in business English.  It is necessary to use BDD and TDD, as BDD focusses on how users solve their problems, not details on whether a particular class is correct. </li>
    <li>Is is a contraction of <i>behaviour driven development</i>.</li>
    <li>A full definition is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development" target="_blank">wiki</a>, and it is discussed in <sup><a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd" target="_blank">1</a></sup> and <sup><a href="https://inviqa.com/blog/bdd-guide" target="_blank">2</a></sup></li>
    <li>Some people claim a very similar behaviour, which they call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development" target="_blank">ATDD</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some test libraries like to push snapshots tests as an easy process.  Snapshot comparison is easy and fast.  But what behaviour does this show?  If you have the BDD test, a snapshot test does nothing extra.  If when lacking a BDD test, doing a “has this changed test” doesn't show delivery of goals.   If a project manager wishes some way to see changes, source version control is a better developed way to achieve this (i.e. git, or hg/mercurial).</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc6"> <a href="#toc6" title="Jump to this section." > What is Regression testing? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Regression testing is a process of applying your existing unit population after later changes to ensure that you haven't broken existing and older features.</li>
    <li>Regression testing is discussed in more detail <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-regression-testing" target="_blank">4</a></sup></li>
    <li>In practice <b>this should be done in every project</b>, as it reduces costs.  It is very simple to setup.  I would suggest adding this step to your build/deploy tool.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc7"> <a href="#toc7" title="Jump to this section." > What is Mutation testing? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>This is currently fashionable in high quality PHP build processes. Oddly this has no acronym yet.  Mutation testing tools report weak areas of the test coverage by applying a mutation to the target code.</li>
    <li>This is discussed in more detail in <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/skylerto/Software-Testing/wiki/09-Mutation-Testing" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MutationTesting" target="_blank">7</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>I have no further details to log in this section at present; there are mutation test frameworks in PHP, Python, JS.  Lastly a vast number in Perl, presumably as it is easy to make single-char errors in Perl.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc8"> <a href="#toc8" title="Jump to this section." > What is Contract testing? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>For distributed or SOA systems; the different sections need to be written to the same style.  The contract test <sup><a href="https://pactflow.io/what-is-contract-testing-page/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/automated-testing/cdc-testing/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> verifies that the contract has been complied to on each side of an internal boundary.  Each section may be done by a different team, so this is important.  </li>
    <li>This process is partially done by the compiler, if you use many Interfaces in your code.   If you publish a Schema for any API, then again standard operational process has adsorbed this test step.   The historical programming language D <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">10</a></sup> has a well defined process for contract tests, which it calls pre-conditions and post-conditions.   A less old example is Golang (see <a href="https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go" target="_blank">Pact</a> <sup><a href="https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/writing-pact-contract-tests-with-golang-2c20b5049e0c" target="_blank">11</a></sup> ).  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please do not confuse with crypto “smart” digital contracts.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc9"> <a href="#toc9" title="Jump to this section." > Manual test platforms <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I got sent this list of tools, at point of print all these companies existed.   Manual testing is important for UX interviews and analysis.   Semi-technical manual testing is good for testing branding and layout issues, but doesn't need a dedicated staff.   The rate of the manual testing can be reduced bu automation via Cypress or Selenium.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Boundary testing is unit-testing where the extreme values are checked; to confirm that possible error states are met correctly.</li>
    <li>This is discussed in more detail at <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_testing" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TestBoundaryConditions" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.</li>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Some languages/platform prefer to structure their Fixture data as a “table” (roughly a 2d array); rather than a separate data structure.  This is not the same as an SQL Fixture which would also be a table. </li>
    <li>I see this term quite alot in Go, and the cucumber toolkit in Java (and I assume wherever cucumber gets its ideas from).</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc12"> <a href="#toc12" title="Jump to this section." > What is Compile testing? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>For larger projects written with strongly typed languages, it is advisable to have a soft step of “does today's work compile”, to be run fairly often.   If there is an oversight, and a technical choice contradicts a behavioural requirement, detecting this as early as possible reduces friction and delays.  With an IDE this probably doesn't need to have an actual test file, or to be checked in to the source control.</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc14"> <a href="#toc14" title="Jump to this section." > Why do I test like this? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I don't have any deep and needy feeling about tests. The various flavours of tests are a risk assessment, or rather the avoidance of risk.  Things normally go wrong, not on first version, but on the later edition that just make a simple change.  These above technologies are the only known solution to being able to avoid these risks.  <br />
A software engineer is someone who creates tools and manages the risks on creating and running them.  A developer is just doing the first clause.  I think in an Agile environment, software engineers are more useful. <br />
