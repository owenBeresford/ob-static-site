<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > This test is too old, as every current browser supports JS modules <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>This article is called this <sup><a href="https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, as I use many OO languages, and do not consider an PHP style “include statement” a good way to manage dependency injection.  Simple JS notes also assert that code should be manually injected with a static locked version.<br />
<em>This article is limited to client side JS.</em>  At point of writing this site has no good process loading JS.  There was originally a small number of JS libraries, and my personal shim to fix (now historical) browser faults.   I have been adding to the UX niceties, so the JS is getting heavier.   I want a better solution than statically linking JS classes in the main/root template.  I am writing an exploration (this text) ahead of any decisions or work.<br />
A few years later I wrote an article about methods to get source code to the client-side, see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-modules-notes#">js-modules-notes</a>.  I suggest reading detailed notes on <a href="https://webperf.tips/tip/cached-js-misconceptions/" target="_blank">JS code loading</a>, published July 2022.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Possible Architectures <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>In terms of architecture, the following approaches exist (this section doesn't mention solutions, or integration costs):</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Correct HTTP caching per file &amp;&amp; inpage shims<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>On the assertion that if each library is already on the client, it can be applied to a page really quickly; this is a very simple solution.</li>
        <li>Use a small section of script on each page that holds configuration for each active module.</li>
        <li>Requires that each page can have separate JS libraries loaded (a CMS management issue).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Server concatenation of JS (like a PAK file).<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Easy to edit the JS source in separate files.</li>
        <li>Would be used with gzip on the network.</li>
        <li>Very easy to make.</li>
        <li>Avoids many HTTP connections, but is mostly obsolete due to HTTP1.1 pipelining.</li>
        <li>Can be dynamically configured for each page, as the files are assembled in real time.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Dynamically server-side compiled buffers from separate source files (like C compilation).<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><b>UPDATE</b> this is called 'a minifier'/ minification; there are many choices.   ⚠ WARN ⚠: it is possible to build JS that makes illegal code when minified.</li>
        <li>Easy to edit the JS source in separate files.</li>
        <li>The compiled form doesn't need white-space, or to be readable (variable name replacement).</li>
        <li>Can include analysis tools to report likely failures.</li>
        <li>This leads to a smaller footprint but static linking.</li>
        <li>When each page uses the same libraries (or SPA), this is efficient.</li>
        <li>With HTTP caching, this should be efficient.</li>
        <li>Due to heavier processing, may wish to build the buffer asynchronously.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Client side library to manage download and lazy loading.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><b>UPDATE</b> An example is <strong>Webpack</strong>, which was first released the year <strong>after</strong> I wrote this article.</li>
        <li>Sensibly, this needs to be made with a callback system (i.e. after I have moduleX, run moduleX init function). This requires architecting from scratch. <em> This is the actual classloading option.</em></li>
        <li>Works better with many different pages as each JS library is only downloaded when requested, meaning the first page is displayed faster.</li>
        <li>Does require an extra library on the client, but this doesn't need to be very large.</li>
        <li>May make page seem slower, due to more complex model (browser parses HTML, downloads 1st JS lib, parses that, then downloads behaviour libs, then parses them)</li>
        <li>Can do more behaviour on failure, than the other solutions...</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Aside: AMD. <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I am not the first person to think that “traditional web designers” leave something to be desired when it comes to code management.  AMD has been designed as a spec to push ideas to webrowsers, and implemented in JS as shims until the browsers are extended to included this idea.  AMD is short for 'Asynchronous module definition' <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  The objective of AMD is an easier way to manage JS class loading, similar to what is used in Java, and more recent versions of Symfony2 (a project started by a Java developer).  There seems to be a project root at <sup><a href="https://github.com/amdjs" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, but I am unable to locate a RFC.  AMD is discussed in the following articles <sup><a href="https://www.devbridge.com/articles/understanding-amd-requirejs/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch11s02.html" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://tomdale.net/2012/01/amd-is-not-the-answer/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://davidwalsh.name/curljs" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.cjgammon.com/requirejs-better-organizing-dependencies/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>...(presented as links as I see no value in copying the content, and google inc agrees with me in this).</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Possible solution for a good JS tool <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>There is little value in writing a platform from scratch, <em>although I can do</em> see [1].  From a quick google search here are some options:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b> Commonjs</b> standard. UPDATE 2019: Last year I started started including a project called CommonJS, to allow deps to load better.   If this was supposed to be used in node, its very browser friendly in architecture.  The project is in NPM <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/common-js" target="_blank">1</a></sup> or <sup><a href="https://unpkg.com/common-js@latest" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, authored by Andrea Giammarchi aka <sup><a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/common-js" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  This library is maintained.  There is more than one implementation for CommonJS, </li>
</ul>

<p>A while ago, there was a standards focussed group called CommonJS <sup><a href="https://www.commonjs.org/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> (didn't directly make any code).  This is focussed on <i>serverside JS</i>, and is mentioned here for completeness; and that if ignorant people are reading this “AMD like” subject, notes on what to ignore may save them time.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>an AMD solution, see above.  In 2023, AMD is still supported by many packing tools, so can be used as an output format for existing platforms.  </li>
    <li><b> RequireJS </b> <sup><a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, a common JS framework for dependency injection.  This has integration with several JS tools such as Angular.</li>
    <li>NOTE browsers can use JS modules for a while <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank">6</a></sup> which makes most earlier technology irrelevant.   This reduces “every symbol is automatically in global scope”, so JS becomes easier to manage </li>
</ul>

<p>Legacy solutions that I think should be avoided:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Steal </b> <sup><a href="https://stealjs.com/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/stealjs/steal" target="_blank">github</a> <a href="https://stealjs.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a>.  This is reviewed as <sup><a href="https://lastzero.net/2012/10/how-to-use-the-stealjs-file-loader-as-a-stand-alone-tool/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, its <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stealjs" target="_blank">stackexchange</a> seems to have sensible questions.  </li>
    <li><b>Dojo toolkit</b> <sup><a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/community/roadmap/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/dojo/loader" target="_blank">github</a>  This project believes in docs in word files, I link the loader <sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gbawq5nhi1GuYuVMoTJBFAzESaqgYKlS_aLzHzaAXs/edit?pref=2&amp;amp;pli=1#heading=h.mknz10lo6jxp" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.  This is distributed with the 'new BSD' licence.   An article advocating Dojo <sup><a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-reasons-why-your-projects-should-use-the-dojo-toolkit--net-26072" target="_blank">11</a></sup> although it seems to have declined popularity <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-has-the-Dojo-toolkit-disappeared-off-peoples-radar" target="_blank">12</a></sup> (for the whole framework..)</li>
    <li><b>curl.js</b> <sup><a href="https://github.com/cujojs/curl" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.  This is a good tool, but it seems the project is suspended, so its use should be considered with caution.</li>
    <li><b> ScriptmanJS </b> I can see notes referencing this on AMD sites.  This site has an expired domain, I assume a dead project.  Google doesn't return the github project either.</li>
    <li>UPDATE: I need to look the tools listed in here <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12893046/how-to-manage-client-side-javascript-dependencies" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Historically there were many JS libraries to inject images into pages (I assume initially for banner ads), for RWD and for delayed loading.  We have better HTML today, so these are not needed.  See lazy loading <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Lazy_loading" target="_blank">15</a></sup>, and PICTURE option <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/picture" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.  I am fairly sure i could build a dynamic loading ad banner with plain CSS, and bypass many JS sniffers.  This idea would require “smart” image selection by the server to chose the best image, but as this is also needed for the auction of the image placed, that's not an extra step.   </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > TODO <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>My actual requirements is to fix the JS HTTP headers, and give the pages a per page module load list.  I don't like “manual include statements”, but this may be the most appropriate level of technology on this site.  I will make/ import a minimiser, as secondary target.  Don't think this is worth a github project for.<br />
Obviously the least stupid solution is to use native require() support in the browser from a HTTP2 server. I am still waiting. <br />
<b>UPDATE2022</b>: forced host upgrade in Q4 2022; I now have HTTP2 at no hassle.   NB: HTTP2 is no longer a hard thing to achieve; I have deployed it commercially.   Secondly, maybe I should look at swapping the many JSON meta files to ProtoBuf.   I think the headers are fixed since 2016; and I have been using a minifier since a bit after I wrote the first version of this article.  I haven't mentioned SPA. Yes. This site is more of a blog, and I don't think people <i>“browse the web”</i> that much after social media got more common in 2007 or something.  Paying SPA overheads if you only read one article is not assisting the user do anything.<br />
A better thing to look at is how can I avoid needing to rewrite all the old 2011 edition JS to ES2020 and JS modules standards, but keep the same user interactions.   I have drop-in upgraded fonts three times since this layout was built.</p>
