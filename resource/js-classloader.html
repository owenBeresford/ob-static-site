<p>This article is called this <sup><a href="https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, as I use many OO languages, and do not consider an PHP style “include statement” a good way to manage dependency injection.  Simple JS notes also assert that code should be manually injected with a static locked version.<br />
<em>This article is limited to client side JS.</em>  At point of writing this site has no good process loading JS.  There was originally a small number of JS libraries, and my personal shim to fix (now historical) browser faults.   I have been adding to the UX niceties, so the JS is getting heavier.   I want a better solution than statically linking JS classes in the main/root template.  I am writing an exploration (this text) ahead of any decisions or work.<br />
A few years later I wrote an article about methods to get source code to the client-side, see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-modules-notes#">js-modules-notes</a>.  I suggest reading detailed notes on <a href="https://webperf.tips/tip/cached-js-misconceptions/" target="_blank">JS code loading</a>, published July 2022.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Possible Architectures <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>In terms of architecture, the following approaches exist (this section doesn't mention solutions, or integration costs):</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Correct HTTP caching per file &amp;&amp; inpage shims<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>On the assertion that if each library is already on the client, it can be applied to a page really quickly; this is a very simple solution.</li>
        <li>Use a small section of script on each page that holds configuration for each active module.</li>
        <li>Requires that each page can have separate JS libraries loaded (a CMS management issue).</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Server concatenation of JS (like a PAK file).<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Easy to edit the JS source in separate files.</li>
        <li>Would be used with gzip on the network.</li>
        <li>Very easy to make.</li>
        <li>Avoids many HTTP connections, but is mostly obsolete due to HTTP1.1 pipelining.</li>
        <li>Can be dynamically configured for each page, as the files are assembled in real time.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Dynamically server-side compiled buffers from separate source files (like C compilation).<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><b>UPDATE</b> this is called 'a minifier'/ minification; there are many choices.   WARN: it is possible to build JS that makes illegal code when minified.</li>
        <li>Easy to edit the JS source in separate files.</li>
        <li>The compiled form doesn't need white-space, or to be readable (variable name replacement).</li>
        <li>Can include analysis tools to report likely failures.</li>
        <li>This leads to a smaller footprint but static linking.</li>
        <li>When each page uses the same libraries (or SPA), this is efficient.</li>
        <li>With HTTP caching, this should be efficient.</li>
        <li>Due to heavier processing, may wish to build the buffer asynchronously.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Client side library to manage download and lazy loading.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><b>UPDATE</b> An example is <strong>Webpack</strong>, which was first released the year <strong>after</strong> I wrote this article.</li>
        <li>Sensibly, this needs to be made with a callback system (i.e. after I have moduleX, run moduleX init function). This requires architecting from scratch. <em> This is the actual classloading option.</em></li>
        <li>Works better with many different pages as each JS library is only downloaded when requested, meaning the first page is displayed faster.</li>
        <li>Does require an extra library on the client, but this doesn't need to be very large.</li>
        <li>May make page seem slower, due to more complex model (browser parses HTML, downloads 1st JS lib, parses that, then downloads behaviour libs, then parses them)</li>
        <li>Can do more behaviour on failure, than the other solutions...</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Aside: AMD. <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I am not the first person to think that “traditional web designers” leave something to be desired when it comes to code management.  AMD has been designed as a spec to push ideas to webrowsers, and implemented in JS as shims until the browsers are extended to included this idea.  AMD is short for 'Asynchronous module definition' <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  The objective of AMD is an easier way to manage JS class loading, similar to what is used in Java, and more recent versions of Symfony2 (a project started by a Java developer).  There seems to be a project root at <sup><a href="https://github.com/amdjs" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, but I am unable to locate a RFC.  AMD is discussed in the following articles <sup><a href="https://www.devbridge.com/articles/understanding-amd-requirejs/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch11s02.html" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://tomdale.net/2012/01/amd-is-not-the-answer/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://davidwalsh.name/curljs" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.cjgammon.com/requirejs-better-organizing-dependencies/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>...(presented as links as I see no value in copying the content, and google inc agrees with me in this).</p>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Possible solution for a good JS tool <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>There is little value in writing a platform from scratch, <em>although I can do</em> see [1].  From a quick google search here are some options:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b> Commonjs</b> standard. UPDATE 2019: Last year I started started including a project called CommonJS, to allow deps to load better.   If this was supposed to be used in node, its very browser friendly in architecture.  The project is in NPM <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/common-js" target="_blank">1</a></sup> or <sup><a href="https://unpkg.com/common-js@latest" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, authored by Andrea Giammarchi aka <sup><a href="https://github.com/WebReflection/common-js" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  This library is maintained.  There is more than one implementation for CommonJS, </li>
</ul>

<p>A while ago, there was a standards focussed group called CommonJS <sup><a href="https://www.commonjs.org/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> (didn't directly make any code).  This is focussed on <i>serverside JS</i>, and is mentioned here for completeness; and that if ignorant people are reading this “AMD like” subject, notes on what to ignore may save them time.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>an AMD solution, see above.  In 2023, AMD is still supported by many packing tools, so can be used as an output format for existing platforms.  </li>
    <li><b> RequireJS </b> <sup><a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, a common JS framework for dependency injection.  This has integration with several JS tools such as Angular.</li>
</ul>

<p>Legacy solutions that I think should be avoided:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Steal </b> <sup><a href="https://stealjs.com/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/stealjs/steal" target="_blank">github</a> <a href="https://stealjs.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a>.  This is reviewed as <sup><a href="https://lastzero.net/2012/10/how-to-use-the-stealjs-file-loader-as-a-stand-alone-tool/" target="_blank">7</a></sup>, its <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stealjs" target="_blank">stackexchange</a> seems to have sensible questions.  </li>
    <li><b>Dojo toolkit</b> <sup><a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/community/roadmap/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/dojo/loader" target="_blank">github</a>  This project believes in docs in word files, I link the loader <sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-gbawq5nhi1GuYuVMoTJBFAzESaqgYKlS_aLzHzaAXs/edit?pref=2&amp;amp;pli=1#heading=h.mknz10lo6jxp" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.  This is distributed with the 'new BSD' licence.   An article advocating Dojo <sup><a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-reasons-why-your-projects-should-use-the-dojo-toolkit--net-26072" target="_blank">10</a></sup> although it seems to have declined popularity <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-has-the-Dojo-toolkit-disappeared-off-peoples-radar" target="_blank">11</a></sup> (for the whole framework..)</li>
    <li><b>curl.js</b> <sup><a href="https://github.com/cujojs/curl" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.  This is a good tool, but it seems the project is suspended, so its use should be considered with caution.</li>
    <li><b> ScriptmanJS </b> I can see notes referencing this on AMD sites.  This site has an expired domain, I assume a dead project.  Google doesn't return the github project either.</li>
    <li>UPDATE: I need to look the tools listed in here <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12893046/how-to-manage-client-side-javascript-dependencies" target="_blank">13</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>My actual requirements is to fix the JS HTTP headers, and give the pages a per page module load list.  I don't like “manual include statements”, but this may be the most appropriate level of technology on this site.  I will make/ import a minimiser, as secondary target.  Don't think this is worth a github project for.<br />
Obviously the least stupid solution is to use native require() support in the browser from a HTTP2 server. I am still waiting. <br />
<b>UPDATE2022</b>: forced host upgrade in Q4 2022; I now have HTTP2 at no hassle.   NB: HTTP2 is no longer a hard thing to achieve; I have deployed it commercially.   Secondly, maybe I should look at swapping the many JSON meta files to ProtoBuf.   I think the headers are fixed since 2016; and I have been using a minifier since a bit after I wrote the first version of this article.  I haven't mentioned SPA. Yes. This site is more of a blog, and I don't think people <i>“browse the web”</i> that much after social media got more common in 2007 or something.  Paying SPA overheads if you only read one article is not assisting the user do anything.<br />
A better thing to look at is how can I avoid needing to rewrite all the old 2011 edition JS to ES2020 and JS modules standards, but keep the same user interactions.   I have drop-in upgraded fonts three times since this layout was built.</p>
