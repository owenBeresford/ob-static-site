<p>This is a list of startups, in London, UK; who have the started aim of reducing carbon footprint for a named business sector.   I made this list as this is a new and expanding market.   Please check last update time-stamp on this article in particular.    <br />
I don't do articles of lists of companies, as that is very dull content.   I wrote this list as I didn't notice “green tech” being a job sector that got attention from investment people in 2015 or earlier.  Yes, individual people and companies did things, e.g. the Princes Trust, or the Bodyshop, or renewable power suppliers; but there was no advertisement for the entire category of systematic investments.<br />
I consider global warming is a massive economy damaging and life expectancy damaging issue.  It is affecting many different systems that humans have been benefiting from for the last thousand plus years (e.g. the Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation <sup><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ocean-current-keeps-europe-warm-weakening-180968784/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> ).  The planet Earth is a closed loop ~ due to gravity ~ extraction of any singular thing without replacement will lead to exhaustion of it (example Helium <sup><a href="https://rockymountainair.com/blog/how-is-helium-extracted/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> ), inescapably.  Until recently there have been very few businesses that operated as though this is a known long-term consequence and existential risk.   We have no planet B, and we will soon have no “planet safety systems” (e.g. Mangroove swamps as a good carbon sink and wave breaker/ storm blocker <sup><a href="https://www.conservation.org/stories/mangroves-facts" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, but being replaced with low density housing in the US, or shrimp farms in Asia) as we are destroying them.   As an example of recent eco-change <sup><a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/9/29/2195755/-Pinning-point-five-collapsed-the-sea-ice-barrier-buttressing-Thwaites-and-Pine-Island-Glacier" target="_blank">4</a></sup> there is now less ice in each pole each summer than previous years for geological time.  The side effect of this ice-sheet collapse is a projected 3m rise in sea levels in less than a decade.</p>

<p>I am not a fervent believer in anything.  This situation is an existential risk, and the fact it will affect your balance sheet negatively doesn't mean it's made up.   There is a lot of hype about investment in carbon credits, and things that look like carbon reduction e.g. <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63089348" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, but don't in-practice work.  The link I included showed up in my socials earlier today, I don't know if there are better examples at present.   BUT on balance, having the investment category is “lessWrong” than not having it.</p>

<p>I am reporting things for the UK, please examine the following.   In my original understanding most of these companies just shuffle government funding/ credits around, so would be in London.  Many of the UK's companies are registered in London.  This may not prove to be correct.

<p><b>Example A</b> of critical failure: rising sea levels flood your stock market and many of your banks (specifically the data-centres, for example in CanaryWharf, which is a few meters above sea level).<br />
<b>Example B</b> of critical failure: water cycles oscillating between drought and flood making current road or rail based networks break every year.  This leads to supply chain failure across entire areas, and suspension of trade for any business in that area.  Drinking water in that area would need to be delivered in sealed containers, as the existing drinking-water systems would be now polluted. <br />
<b>Example C</b> of critical failure: extreme heat for months in the local summer, leading to electric distribution systems failing, as they were built for a colder climate northern Europe, and also increased fire risk.</p>
