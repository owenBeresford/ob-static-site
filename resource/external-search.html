<p>This article is called <i>external-search</i> as I am often employed to create or extend search with a company's dataset.  <i>External-search</i> is concentrating on publicly accessible data (including things that content creators forgot was public, like word files), and rarely needs identification or authentication.<br />
In 2003 I wrote my first article on search and comparative features.  Every few years I write a new one, with different content.  <strong>NOTE:</strong> search as an industry seems to be sensitive to people checking if links have been changed.  My tooltip feature is just so I don't sent you to dead links, if the tooltip says dead the remote website may have lied to the link checker.</p>

<p>Note: market success percentages for each engine should be taken as an approximation.  If you go to three different news sites you get three different values.  I think the market percentage ratios between the engines won't change.</p>

<p>Note: I list the carbon neutral scoring, as running an LLM on a widely used service is a very heavy consumer for drinking water and power.   LLM directly use a lot of power, and the drinking water is used for the air-con in the server farm.   Server farms do alter the water table in arid regions; so other all local businesses are affected.  Especially when linked to the fact that the larger corporations rarely pay taxes, and push local housing prices up, this has a strong impact on the local economy.   I expect users <i>may be</i> casually interested in-passing, but please do not take this as a heavy-handed hint about anything.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> If for some reason you need to use an AI, I have been recommended about: <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" target="_blank">Perplexity</a> and <a href="https://poe.com/universal_link_page?handle=Claude-2-100k" target="_blank">Poe/Claude</a></p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Important features for search <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>takes search query, returns 3rd party site URLs that seem to be about the query</li>
    <li>supports typo fixing <i>AND</i></li>
    <li>supports booleans, literal strings and +/- terms<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>literal strings suppress typo fixing</li>
        <li>+/- terms allow a query to be in a particular domain, not the most common one</li>

    <li>supports site constraint</li>
    <li>supports age limit constraints</li>
    <li>allow deletion of any profile data harvested about the user, or the users unique ids</li>
    <li>everything that is a paid-ad is marked as “paid ad” in some fashion ~ when searching for <i>“wet weather saab tires”</i>, ads are useful to the user, when searching for <i>“model hydration error saab catalogue”</i>, ads for car parts are less so.</li>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Recent history <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I am not impressed with the current generation of LLM that has been blindly applied to many websites.   For example the AI that Linkedin uses has said I ~ the candidate ~ shouldn't apply for a particular role as I ~ the candidate ~ didn't have “Employee Benefits”.   We can read data from <i>/dev/random</i> at much lower effort and expense.  In theory LLM are useful <sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02441" target="_blank">1</a></sup>; but they need cleaner data first.   The US free speech rules mean that many US people post stuff that is outside of 'corporate voice'.   This shouldn't be included in the LLM dataset.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><strong>Duck-duck-go</strong> buy results from Bing and a list of places <sup><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19380174" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  I can't find the index size.  Also see linked data trackers no longer sent to MSFT <sup><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/05/duckduckgo-microsoft-tracking-scripts/?g" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.   They have 2.6% market share in 2021 <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-vs-duckduckgo/301997/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  DDG support +/- but do not include word stemming during query construction.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Duck Duck Go claim to be carbon negative <sup><a href="https://technical.ly/civic-news/duckduckgo-carbon-negative/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/duckduckgo-invests-in-carbon-offsets-making-it-carbon-negative/" target="_blank">7</a></sup></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Google</strong> has published Bard, but does have “100s of billions of pages indexed” <sup><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/organizing-information/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, and claims 86.6 - 92% of the search market <sup><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/google-vs-bing-vs-duckduckgo-ultimate-search-engine/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-vs-microsoft-bing/400855/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   The range of numbers is from different sources, and I assume made by different processes; it was from 2021 in each case.  There are pages on how to remove Bard extra indexing <sup><a href="https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13278892?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, and Bard crawling your site <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-extended-crawler-432636" target="_blank">12</a></sup>; but for standard users.  <strong>UPDATE Oct2023:</strong> Bard is not used for casual users, unless they go to the bard.google.com URL <sup><a href="https://support.google.com/bard/answer/13275745" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.  Release log <sup><a href="https://bard.google.com/updates" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.   Corporate accounts can disable Bard <sup><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/admin-control-for-bard-access.html" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.  A temporary front end for Google to side step much of the AI “answers” <sup><a href="https://udm14.com/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>, and <a href="https://github.com/readtedium/udm14" target="_blank">git</a>. <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Google is currently carbon neutral <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54141899" target="_blank">17</a></sup> and is working towards no sum carbon emissions ever <sup><a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/net-zero-carbon/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.  I since saw this non-functional objective was shelved to achieve some LLM features.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Bing</strong> has integrated it's copy of ChatGPT <sup><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/bing-chat?form=MT00D8" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bing-ai-chatbot-7371141" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.  According to <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-vs-microsoft-bing/400855/" target="_blank">21</a></sup> Bing has 6.7% of the search market, and hoped to cash in on market-share with this bot.  A different page on that site has Bing's index to be between 8-14 billion pages <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-vs-microsoft-bing/400855/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>.  Livewire says to get traditional search features, don't use the voice input, just enter keywords.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Microsoft have carbon nullifying plans, ~ for the entire business ~ but are stretched over a longer timescale <sup><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability-journey" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Most people do not use <strong>Amazon</strong> as a search engine, but as a portal to access thousands of small merchants and millions of products, technically it needs to be.   It places high visibility on paid placement results, and sometimes just random results that sell well.   In the early 2000s, marketing people were really impressed with the “you may also be interested in” feature, but its just big data.   There are bots to create text about products on sale <sup><a href="https://copymonkey.ai/" target="_blank">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.writecream.com/amazon-listing-generator/" target="_blank">26</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://anyword.com/amazon-product-description-generator/" target="_blank">27</a></sup> (just a few for an example), but an LLM on Amazon doesn't make sense.</li>
    <li><strong>Baidu</strong> is the biggest search engine in China, and focussed on Chinese websites.   As it doesn't bother with English, it gets ignored in many US-based articles.  However it is one of the larger media companies in the world <sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/8084/baidu-inc/#topicOverview" target="_blank">28</a></sup> (by ad revenue).  Baidu has a separate service called 'Baidu index' which is like Google Zeitgeist.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Baidu claim that they will be carbon neutral by 2030 <sup><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/baidu-announces-goal-to-achieve-carbon-neutral-operations-by-2030-2021-06-22" target="_blank">29</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://pandaily.com/baidu-announces-six-paths-to-realizing-its-2030-carbon-neutrality-target/" target="_blank">30</a></sup></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>Ask</strong> formerly AskJeeves feels like an AI with its language synthesis [they deleted their about us page, and /help is talking about stuff from ages ago].  In 2010, they are stated to have withdrawn from general search <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11729051" target="_blank">31</a></sup>, I think they have &lt;0.5% search queries anyway.   </li>
    <li><strong>Yandex</strong> search is more popular in the Russian federation, and the company runs a big suite of technologies.   It is currently impacted by sanctions on buying more servers as they hold chips. <b>UPDATE:</b> I note that Yandex is legally a Dutch company based in Schiphol (see dutch company registry, which won't let me copy and paste OR make links). </li>
</ul>

<p>This above list is focussed on established companies who can make large investments.</p>

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > The UK market for search <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>This article now focusses on the UK search engine.  If mr Mishra is correct, and most search is local; then it makes sense to have a local engine, targeting local websites.  I don't think a resident of Tokyo is interested in the opening hours of my local <i>Sainsburies</i>, also I get little value from knowing the opening hours of their <i>Seiyu</i>.   We can ignore each other for this item by spelling-out the name of the premise, in the normal language used to communicate.  Noting I normally type “supermarket near me open now”, there are 8 large ones inside 5km, I assume the same would be true for of most of Tokyo.</p>

<p>As a description of Search as market, the UK is about 70 million people, 92% of which are fairly often internet users <sup><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2019" target="_blank">1</a></sup> ~ this is 2019 numbers, note Covid has changed everything.  The lowest net-use ~ not surprisingly ~ is the elderly, but net-use is now at 54% in that segment.  Uswitch says most people have a smart phone, and about half have a big screen device on the internet <sup><a href="https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/studies/mobile-statistics/#uk-mobile-phone-market-share-2022" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  Statistica also state that 93% of people use Google, but less use Bing than above <sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/280269/market-share-held-by-search-engines-in-the-united-kingdom/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  And “the UK is responsible for almost four percent of Google.com’s worldwide traffic, with its own powerful local domain, Google.co.uk.&quot; <sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6590/search-engines-in-the-uk/#topicOverview" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.   According to <sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265825/number-of-searches-worldwide/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> the most popular query to Google this year was “google”, and the next top 10 items was where mostly other net brands.  The outlier was “weather”.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The ONS “people who recently used the internet” number matches Statistica “people who recently used the internet from a smart phone” which is weird.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Alternative vendors <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>The USA does have the majority of large internet corporations, but is not the majority of the population.   I may iterate this to a chart, adding more detail, and a column with “does this look a lot like Google?&quot;.<br />
I am getting some <i>“content not available in this region”</i> errors, which I think is made by CloudFlare  and is an empty cache issue.   Apparently I am the first person near London/ maybe on my ISP to access these websites, since last cache refresh duration.  Given that original cultural TV channels matching these sites (listed below) are popular in the UK (via Satellite), this feels weird.</p>

Maybe due to mobile use, or maybe due to social structures, the average net user doesn't look at websites, they just use a portal or media platform (same reference) ~ <i>this applies to me also, but I have a more technical focus</i>.    Try <a href="https://www.so.com/?src=haosou.com" target="_blank">Haosuo / Qihoo 360</a>, <a href="https://www.sogou.com/" target="_blank">Sogou / “Search-Dog”</a>, <a href="https://m.sm.cn/" target="_blank">Shenma</a>, or <a href="https://www.youdao.com/" target="_blank">Youdao</a>.  </li>

<p>Google inc is a very large corporation that is very profitable, and spends vast amounts on R&amp;D to keep their position in the market.  They have strong data capture and user profiling features to be able to sell targeted advertising.   After ChatGPT did a few successful demos, all the main stream search engines thought they needed to make a solution with an AI to keep current market share.  In this context <i>“move fast and break stuff”</i> seems risky near elections.<br />
I looked at alternatives, and the results are listed here.  I think reducing the data that users feed google would be a smart idea; and I make claims about search locality, to make search relevance easier.</p>
