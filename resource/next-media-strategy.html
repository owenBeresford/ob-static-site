<p>Pushing ideas into public consensus has changed quite a lot in the last 100 years.  We have vastly changed the technology used to publish content.   Most businesses want to publish about themselves to improve their brand, reputation; and seek more sales.  You can easily find a thousand texts/ MBA books describing that process, so I'm not focussing on it.   My Twitter handle is channelOwen, this is a new version of corporate “blah-blah-online” names from the 90s; but Twitter seems designed for holding channels.   A person who likes consuming pictures and memes would probably focus on pinterest, IG or imgur but keep the same data “stream” idea.<br />
In the last several start-ups I have worked for, I noticed when I joined that people seem to have a static list of vendors for “inbound marketing”, without consideration that the list was built in about 2009 and doesn't seem to have been updated.  Yes there is very good tooling for posting to Facebook; but if you are after a late-teen/ twenties user-base, this is poor targeting.  My other half is studying SEO at present; AFAICT the best method to communicate with users is <em>still</em> a consumer-built mailing list.  According to <sup><a href="https://www.fannit.com/social-media/social-media-sites/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, the top three social media are FB, youtube and whatsapp; but useful numbers would eliminate all the duplicate/ shadow accounts and branding pages from being seen as real users.  I saw people saying they use Tiktok to research things; so I'm looking at what you need 'to marketeer in 2022' rather than just repeating stuff from 2009; NB: I am only going to perform the <em>martech</em> end of the work.</p>

<p>This list doesn't include links to service, as a) some are pre-computer, b) most are apps rather than sites.   After I finished creating this article, I found <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_platforms_with_at_least_100_million_active_users" target="_blank">1</a></sup> which is broadly the same content.  Mine is abit more detailed.   Note I haven't detailed many chat clients; as although one can post links in them, its not broadcast, and there are no types of rich snippets supported.  The client client in FB does use the same summary data that google SERPs do.</p>

<p>Obviously no-one in the past could have hired you or me as we are today.  What do we do to make content in our platforms findable (the point of me doing the below research)?</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>For everything before 2000, the best you could do was add your URL to the end on your paid placement, as outbound marketing. Its expensive, and not very precise or reliable.</li>
    <li>There are still two basic approaches: post a “inline ad”/ advertorial/ attention seeking message and make it interesting enough; or buy a paid ad.  If I am an armchair seller, I can talk about chairs on my website, so people searching for “chair things” are more likely to skim my site.  As a non-stupid chair seller, I understand that most people will not randomly buy chairs on a whim, or a celebrity telling them to.</li>
    <li>If I am good with design/ cartoons, I may be able to make a meme which highlights something relevant, and then mentions the armchairs.  This sliding into online conversations is widely used and widely ignored by casual internet people.  By 2022, this is Very hit and miss, unless you skillfully make a 'funny message' as first priority, and are funny.  Most people aren't very funny <sup><a href="https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1551940918932119554" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  The images are normally called info-graphics.</li>
    <li>I can set up a long series of posts on a platform to try to force the Noösphere <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere" target="_blank">2</a></sup> to include my products (equivalent to 'The Coca cola company' saying that everyone drinks coke every Xmas, and that is what all the small children are excited about).  This costs lots of money and time, but distorting general ideas gives you a secure market place (referencing Coke again, historically people didn't drink cold sweet fizzy drinks very much; 'the coca cola company' is a market-maker).  This is business studies and outside of the scope of this article.  I have used the legal name for the company according to US dividend statements to SEC.</li>
    <li>I can setup a large scale coupon process; in a completely different market sector (traditionally cereals) to sell the idea of defraying the expensive cost of randomly buying armchairs; by buying excess cereals.  In a more modern market; I could sell the coupons in “internet minutes” cards for PAYG mobile-internet; or prizes for supermarket loyalty card points.   </li>
    <li>I could fund a cultural event/ product, and use the marketing for the event to promote my company and products.  A historical example of this was presenting tobacco advertising at football and auto-racing events.  Not cheap.  A more modern version would be DLC for a popular game, say Fortnite.</li>
    <li>Chairs aren't the best product fit with Amazon; however I can sell armchairs to people who browse Amazon, and the social search feature. This has the impact of reducing the margin to my business per unit by quite a large amount.</li>
    <li>I can persuade (via a different company) people to install an app; that logs GPS locations, and supplies adverts relevant to the locations.  With price manipulation, the adverts can include discounts that just sell products at a lower markup, similar to “cheap shops” sale rates.  See foursquare. </li>
    <li>For various market sectors, people search in a search engine (classically google); search in pinterest; search in Tiktok. The references below lists how to put information into your website, so any time the first two products interact with it, the user gets a clear ~ hopefully persuasive ~ message.  A process that the US citizens do is to ideate “things I could buy” as a hobby.   They permanently look at advertising to get ideas for buying things; regardless of need.  </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Targeted Literature survey <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>To be supportive of google indexing is well understood, pls see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/webpage-micro-data#">webpage-micro-data</a>, or <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/special-tags" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  Search engines indexing, including that done by Google can be controlled by a robots.txt <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_meta_tag" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.   Meta data for Twitter and Facebook is listed in the first link also.  Bing is also covered by the article reference at the start of the paragraph.</li>
    <li>Articles on youtube meta data, are for tagging content on uploaded videos <sup><a href="https://backlinko.com/get-youtube-views" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://themarketingheaven.com/a-guide-to-the-basics-of-youtube-metadata/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.canto.com/blog/youtube-metadata/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.bbtv.com/blog/use-metadata-to-grow-youtube-channel/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, rather than for external services.  The data can be entered by the youtube GUI; the last link describes successful authoring behaviour, which is the same as other contexts.  They state that youtube moderates meta data by user attention in response to the upload.  The process to buy ads on youtube <sup><a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/youtube-ads/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/ads/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>Linkedin reads open graph meta data articles <sup><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a521928/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin?lang=en" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.  It has an inspection tool to show you what other people will see <sup><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/" target="_blank">12</a></sup>, including that last scrape date, so you can retrigger a scrap if your “prime version” has changed recently.  Apparently linkedin supports hashtags <sup><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-find-trending-linkedin-hashtags-2022-sudhir-mishra" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, but I think you need to be a recruiter to use them (I can't see when I would search by trend inside linkedin). </li>
    <li>Images work better on instagram <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram" target="_blank">14</a></sup>, if they are tagged <sup><a href="https://www.instagram-tags.com/" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-hashtags/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.  Using really overused hashtags apparently makes your content easier to find (reverse of google searching) <sup><a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/instagram-hashtags" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.  It is also suggested to tag products, if the image is a corporate post <sup><a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-feed-product-tagging" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.   As a normal social media platform, instagram supports paid ads <sup><a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising" target="_blank">19</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.    </li>
    <li>In 2015, Pinterest had more interesting SEO options (I don't use Pinterest, but I think these are still supported): on any IMG tag on your site, you may add Pinterest data attributes that supply pin-id, better titles, a high res version, a reference URL <sup><a href="https://css-tricks.com/using-pinterest-data-attributes-and-meta-tags/" target="_blank">21</a></sup>. Pinterest supports “richpins”, which are basically the same meta data that google reads: Open Graph/ “og”, Schema.org, hRecipe, or oEmbed <sup><a href="https://bloggingunplugged.com/set-up-rich-pins/" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://louisem.com/7239/pinterest-rich-pins" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://traciefobes.com/rich-pins-on-pinterest-why-they-matter/" target="_blank">24</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.individualobligation.com/how-to-install-rich-pins/" target="_blank">25</a></sup>.  I have listed a range of articles here, as they each do a different meta-data category.  Pinterest has an API to be able to do the previous actions at scale <sup><a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/" target="_blank">26</a></sup> and again for shopping <sup><a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/solutions/pinterest-api-for-shopping/" target="_blank">27</a></sup> .  When publishing for Pinterest, the recommended image sizes are precise <sup><a href="https://www.tailwindapp.com/blog/pinterest-image-size" target="_blank">28</a></sup>.   I can't find any references to Pinterest supporting OBJECT or PICTURE tags, but many devs put a backup IMG inside these, so that may not be an issue.</li>
    <li>Tiktok is a major video streaming platform; it supports hashtags <sup><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/tiktok-hashtags/" target="_blank">29</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/tiktok-hashtags/" target="_blank">30</a></sup>, you can buy ad slots on it <sup><a href="https://www.upwork.com/resources/tiktok-marketing" target="_blank">31</a></sup> (normally a video with a CTA at the end).  I am unable to discover much content for meta data that Tiktok uses/ reads (maybe it doesn't); but there are several options for styles of ad placed <sup><a href="https://www.semetrical.com/tiktok-marketing-on-social-media/" target="_blank">32</a></sup>.  Notes say there are many business reluctant to buy slots on Tiktok, so you may get more impact due to lower saturation of other companies.   </li>
    <li>Vimeo <sup><a href="https://www.videomaker.com/how-to/profitmaking/distribution/what-is-vimeo-ott/" target="_blank">33</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo" target="_blank">34</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.outbrain.com/blog/online-video-advertising-guide/" target="_blank">35</a></sup>.  All the vimeo docs I can find are in video format.  Vimeo supports tagging <sup><a href="https://vimeo.com/702923665" target="_blank">36</a></sup>, but has no results for 'meta data'.   Vimeo states it is trying to limit itself to corporate user <sup><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979126/vimeo-patreon-creators-price-increase" target="_blank">37</a></sup>.   There are many video streaming services, but this article was trying to get “common” ones, with more than 100M users per month.  For some other options look at <sup><a href="https://www.adamenfroy.com/video-platforms" target="_blank">38</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.videoconverterfactory.com/tips/video-sharing-website.html" target="_blank">39</a></sup></li>
    <li>Some services are awkward to categorise, 4chan <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan" target="_blank">40</a></sup> is a good example.  It has no user accounts, so the userbase would be entirely a function of unique sessions.  I haven't put much work into this platform, as I cannot see being hired for a service that would go anyway near “4chan's ideas of normal”.   </li>
    <li>Twitch supports tagging <sup><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-is-making-major-changes-to-its-tag-system" target="_blank">41</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.streamscheme.com/best-tags-for-twitch/" target="_blank">42</a></sup>. A list of well known tags <sup><a href="https://www.gamingzombies.com/blog/twitch-tags/" target="_blank">43</a></sup>.   As is standard Twitch offers paid ads, with a couple of different formats <sup><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/twitch-ads/" target="_blank">44</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/twitch-ads-incentive-program/" target="_blank">45</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://launchkit.io/twitch-affiliate-vs-partner/" target="_blank">46</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://thesavvycouple.com/make-money-on-twitch/" target="_blank">47</a></sup> these articles are sales articles and abit fluffy; but they outline strategies.  Twitch does moderate 'speech' (i.e. either audio or chat messages), which given a US male teen gaming user-base this is wise <sup><a href="https://www.streamscheme.com/what-you-cant-say-on-twitch-or-mixer/" target="_blank">48</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>Foursquare, as originally sold in 2010 is no longer a service/ platform that people use.  The company is still running, selling the data that people previously gave them <sup><a href="https://slidebean.com/story/how-foursquare-survives-evolution-slidebean" target="_blank">49</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/" target="_blank">50</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/you-may-have-forgotten-foursquare-it-didnt-forget-you/" target="_blank">51</a></sup></li>
    <li>Quora does have API access <sup><a href="https://github.com/quora-api" target="_blank">52</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://apilist.fun/api/quora-api" target="_blank">53</a></sup>.  Quora supports tagging for user accounts <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-tag-someone-in-an-answer-on-Quora?share=1" target="_blank">54</a></sup>. Quora users are used to count influence in Googles algorithms <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-quora-why-should-you-care/379341/#close" target="_blank">55</a></sup>. As a Q&amp;A site, Quora allows image posting; but doesn't need large amounts of meta data.  I haven't noticed markup features (e.g. tooltips) on content whilst using the site. </li>
    <li>I haven't looked up details for Amazon, as people do not share anything into the Amazon shop listings.  When you make an Amazon shop listing; if you add all the meta data, descriptions, and good photos; your goods are likely to sell better.  AFAIK, the social search feature of Amazon is purely an emergent data structure without needing any meta data.  As I make digital products, what I do is not sold in Amazon shops.</li>
    <li>Imgur user journey <sup><a href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/imgur/what-is-imgur.html" target="_blank">56</a></sup> and it has an API for posting at scale <sup><a href="https://apidocs.imgur.com/" target="_blank">57</a></sup>. As faction/ sub-service of Reddit, I think it believes its a micro-service, and is pure by having narrow functionality.</li>
    <li>I am unable to find any microformats, meta-data or tagging for reddit; everything is done by a human, for better or for worse <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit" target="_blank">58</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>In case you blinked, or read too fast the data for Twitter is described in <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/webpage-micro-data#">webpage-micro-data</a>.</li>
