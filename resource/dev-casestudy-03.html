<p>I am an Agile developer (...something that many people will claim), but I think that older terminology is useful here; as it shows the progress of objectives better than “its Agile innit!&quot;.  I have spiraled in terms of what I'm focussing on.   I emphasise here in the intro that this is a <i>real scenario</i>, and not “made up for a blog article”.   If you have no interest in managing software creation, I suggest you do something other than read this article.   As someone who is working at new startups, I build a product; then another.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Most of these points fit into 1 week sprints, with a clearly defined and testable deliverable at the end of each item.  As would be expected, the features that required less work where not in a sprint by themselves.</li>
    <li>Items marked 'feature' are things you talk about to clients/leads.</li>
    <li>Every item with time spend for 'performance' was to scale up to client expected data volumes, and not assume everyone is a patient developer.</li>
    <li>Most items marked 'quality'; a) perform an observable thing for features b) reduce RAM used, so the product can be run on a wider variety of client machines c) increase readability, so later dev work is faster/ responsive and cheaper.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the start I am adding features (which tends to slow the rate of change of user stories); at the end I am adding quality (which increases user stickyness, and reduces user churn).</p>

<p>At my current employer, I am responsible for making the GUIs, for UX decisions, for software doing client communication etc.   We have alot of numerical data, which is best presented as a graph (or just not presented).   My CTO is a physics grad, and “does graphs” as an academic accomplishment.   Talking about graphing, for the second product, I performed in chronological sequence:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>[FEATURE] Chose a graph library which supported RWD, as it was SVG.  Added enough code that it could render DB records.</li>
    <li>[FEATURE] Added visual features, so that it complied to the CTOs “graphing rules” (e.g. unlike Excel, smart rounding rules on axis labels).</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] At this point, everything relating to data was low quality and quick; add tests to my REST API code (and make changes), and report bugs to the C++ team, who where generating this data.</li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] Most of the time cost to get a graph is extracting data from the DB.  Make REST API run faster by using more complex SQL.  Secondly leverage some more complex features on the DB schema.</li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] Use REST library/ middleware better, so we can support longer periods, with a sensible execution delay.</li>
    <li>[FEATURE] Add graphing for more types of data (same DB).   </li>
    <li>[FEATURE] Add ability to update graph without remove/ adding it (used when changing report time). </li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] In networking; change from every action fulfilment having its own queue; to a shared network queue.   Was unable to find OSS for this, so wrote entire feature.  This is a better architecture, and has much higher performance overall system.   Removes a class of network issues. </li>
    <li>[QUALITY] As a feature of last point, deal with network timeouts (a frequent 'feature' of the RAM-starved VPN endpoint).  Implementation 1</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Actually design a colour scheme, add much better layout with CSS.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Stop data coming out of the middleware in random orders, as this makes the graphs incorrect. Implementation 1</li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] Juggle work inside the REST API (more tests), trimming another 10% off the execution delay.</li>
    <li>[FEATURE] Add extra composite graph type, which shows trends very clearly; requires next change.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Improve use of Models and Collections inside the client-side code. Side effects are its easier to read, uses less RAM, another graph type is possible and the logging is more coherent. </li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Demonstrate current RWD in graphs (and slightly improve CSS to make this work nicely).</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Sort raw data at last possible point, as this stops a few edge cases occurring; at the expense of more RAM on the client.  Random order data implementation 2.</li>
    <li>[FEATURE] Add 'print colour scheme', immediately to support the marketing team; although I can see the same work happening at a clients office.</li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] Juggle code layout, so it uses permanent processes, and incidentally is faster. Also people from other dev languages think ObjectComposition is easier to read.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Add another Service layer to graph generation; simplifying earlier code.  Secondly this improves persistence of state, with regards to user preferences in graphs.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Add an extra layer of events to be able to spot a different set of network timeouts. Implementation 2.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Create another layer of networking code, effectively making an “enterprise architecture” in-house (I was very busy that week).  Full state is cached on the client side, so everything seems faster.</li>
    <li>[PERFORMANCE] Create more DB tables, holding denormalised data; so are faster for reads.</li>
    <li>[QUALITY] Write a “data quality report” for technical clients; to look at the data they have. Incidentally showing results to devops team who improve the product.</li>
</ul>
