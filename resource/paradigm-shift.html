<div class="fewWords paradigmShiftContainer" >
<p>Once upon a time people argued that TDD is impossible.<br />
You can't write a test first, obviously, because you can't test something that doesn't exist. It's obviously ludicrous.<br />
<i>But you change how you think about “a test” and it works just fine.</i></p>

<p>Likewise, two people working at one machine? Ludicrous! That's twice the cost! <i>Except that when you realize that programming isn't typing, it makes easy sense, and it also works just fine.</i></p>

<p>An mobbing! Why, how stupid must that be!!!! Having five or six people work on one task is horribly wasteful... <i>until you learn that it gets work done quickly by putting the right number of brains and set of skills on the task.</i> It works fine.</p>

<p>And evolutionary design! What kind of an idiot would think you should write code before you have a complete and detailed system design?! Except that you design in refactoring, <i>which is a new way of thinking about design and it works just fine.</i></p>

<p>Self organizing? How ludicrous! To think that coders, UX, testing, BAs, ops and other functions can choose their own work and coworkers task by task? Chaos! <i>Except that people do it, and it works just fine.</i></p>

<p>LEAN STARTUP!? What madness is that? Building features and products and then switching customers and products ~ not even knowing what you're building and who for? <i>Except that you change how you think about “customers” and it works just fine and produces some successes (even $M).</i></p>

<p>NOT WRITING COMPREHENSIVE COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE? NOT FOLLOWING SINGLE-ENTRY, SINGLE-EXIT? Not wise. <i>Except that it works just fine if you change how you write your code.</i></p>

<p>Running interpreted languages in production!? That will NEVER perform AT ALL!!! In VIRTUAL MACHINES!? That's moronic. <i>Except that it works extremely well. It happens every day. It's fine.</i></p>

<p>Releasing monthly? No? WEEKLY? No way! No? DAILY!? That's going to be nothing but disaster. <i>Except that orgs release hundreds of times per day, and if you change how you build and deliver, it works just fine.</i></p>

<p>Working without PROJECTS? That's surely mad. Except that product orgs do this all the time, no projects, no funding-by-project, no staffing-by-project; surely there will be no accountability!? <i>Except it works just fine all over the world.</i></p>

<p>Letting customers see work that hasn't been finished and released yet?!<br />
Surely this is suicide! They'll be disappointed and angry, and will not work with us! <i>Except that this kind of feedback loop is commonplace now, and it works just fine.</i></p>

<p>Working without estimating all the work in advance and making promises and plans and budgets based on the estimates? Impossible! <i>Except that people think differently about budgets and estimates and plans, and it seem to work just fine.</i></p>

<p>Nearly everything that vintage 1985 otter would have thought madness, foolishness, and impossibility has become not only possible but commonplace.<br />
When people work together, nothing is beyond them.<br />
You have to ask, what impossible thing is going to be done next?<br />
I think we have to check our incredulity at the door.<br />
As we used to think, none of this could have happened.<br />
We change how we think, and new vistas open up.<br />
Who knows what is next?</p>
