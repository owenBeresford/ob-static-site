<p>Backfill notes on this protocol.   I'm fairly sure every dev after intern status has used web-sockets, but it is often treated in a less mature engineering fashion.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Intro / Assorted facts <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Devs with languages skills beyond JS will recognise a TCP socket.  </li>
    <li>It is not real-time, unlike various adverts, although it is a much faster turn-round time than wordpress.  UDP for a simpler so faster solution than HTTP networking <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>This has RFC <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html" target="_blank">RFC6455</a> <sup><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8441" target="_blank">RFC8441</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7977.html" target="_blank">RFC7977</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9220.html" target="_blank">RFC9220</a>  and a Wiki <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   The wiki page can be used for an overview ~ I don't think repeating these words would help.</li>
    <li>Websockets <sup><a href="https://websocket.org/reference/websocket-api" target="_blank">4</a></sup> have been a widely available technology since 2014 <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=websockets" target="_blank">5</a></sup> API for client-side Object <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket" target="_blank">6</a></sup> </li>
    <li>An alternative idea from Apple is live-streaming <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming" target="_blank">7</a></sup>, seems to be for video streams.   If you want Websockets but for large data, and are OK with Chrome only, try a Stream version <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocketStream" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.   In the past there was HTTP PUSH in HTTP2, but that is heavily deprecated in most software, as the idea didn't work.   There is a WebWorker push feature <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, but it doesn't mention how to create these on this link (I hope it's not the previous link).</li>
    <li>Websockets are a 1-to-1 protocol, for 1-to-many / broadcast look at Server side events <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7636165/how-do-server-sent-events-actually-work" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events" target="_blank">11</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>As a data protocol, rather than text document transaction protocol, there are no document fragments (mentioned in first Wiki). </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Solution characteristics <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Stereotypically for time sensitive data, where a full webpage doesn't help.   </li>
    <li>Websockets do not help with TCP performance, the physical network or physical distance from a server.   They do side-step everything in HTTP, see also HTTP streaming <sup><a href="https://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_API.html" target="_blank">12</a></sup> </li>
    <li>For time-limited, or latency-sensitive data, HTTP caching, web SEO, and HTTP search tech are irrelevant. </li>
    <li>For traffic with <i>many</i> small transactions, a different protocol to HTTP may be faster.  A websocket is an alternative.</li>
    <li>For data where the number of possible copies needs to be limited, HTTP will need special handling, or not to be used.   A websocket is an over-engineered alternative.</li>
    <li>Note that by the time Websockets matured, HTTP2 was mature, they offer similar outcomes <sup><a href="https://dev-aditya.scribe.rip/websockets-vs-http-2-choosing-the-right-protocol-for-real-time-and-high-performance-applications-72ffc0107073" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, <i>BUT</i> HTTP2 applies to your whole site (and should be used for other reasons).</li>
    <li>IMPORTANT: a Websocket doesn't follow the 2 HTTP connections per domain, so allows faster flow of information to browsers <sup><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30314281" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.  HTTP is also limited to 6 IPs concurrently. </li>
    <li>Due to no server sockets involved, Websockets will exhaust available IP ports on servers faster than HTTP1 does.  If a Websocket isn't left open (ie being used for a chat client), this is similar to HTTP2.  </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Use cases <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Prompt Chat clients</li>
    <li>Competitive bidding API on something</li>
    <li>Games with real-time and multi-player interactions ~ use traffic habits that mix both the above items</li>
    <li>Collaborative editing / multiple author tools</li>
    <li>Data that services wish to avoid being found in HTTP caching services / search engines</li>
    <li>Data media streaming, AKA  webRTC <sup><a href="https://www.humanlevel.com/en/blog/web-development/html5-webrtc-api" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/webrtc-test#">webrtc-test</a></li>
    <li>It was my original idea to include a [Sample], but I can't run it here.   I will extend to include src with error handling etc.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Scaling <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Obviously all generic scaling tools like front-side cache, etc will apply to an architecture that also uses Websockets.   See <sup><a href="https://namastedev.com/blog/frontend-caching-strategies-explained/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> for more details.  </li>
    <li>According to <sup><a href="https://programmersforce.co.uk/blogs/html-over-websockets-the-future-of-web-software/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, on average, a HTTP2 transaction has a 2,000 byte overhead.  A Websocket has 2 bytes.  Particularly for many small transactions ~ like a single real-time chat message ~ this is a visible percentage.</li>
    <li>According to <sup><a href="https://www.clrn.org/how-many-websockets-can-a-server-handle/" target="_blank">19</a></sup>, a range of concurrent Websockets per server are guesstimated.  For sensible use, reference 5,000 – 20,000 end-users, concurrently.</li>
    <li>Assuming Node as the server-side language, the memory handling is a bit fiddly ~ see <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30608110/why-does-node-js-have-incremental-memory-usage" target="_blank">20</a></sup> or it has a leak.</li>
    <li>Assuming the work is using Node, it's recommended to use ws or tsws, rather than sockjs.  The average consensus is that extra features of sockjs do not deliver value eg <sup><a href="https://blog.poespas.me/posts/2024/06/02/node-js-optimizing-websocket-performance/" target="_blank">21</a></sup> but I read this multiple times.   </li>
    <li>A Linux server is better optimised for high traffic network operations than win32 machines.  Also the Linux server should be tweaked to support larger numbers of file-handles and open ports <sup><a href="https://cromwell-intl.com/open-source/performance-tuning/tcp.html" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@b0ld8/unlock-open-file-limit-bc3b0733a5f4" target="_blank">23</a></sup>, a longer theory and data <sup><a href="https://community.jisc.ac.uk/system/files/86/BrianTierneyNFNN2.pdf" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.    </li>
    <li>Obviously communication via shorter messages can happen faster than longer ones.   If the messages in the Websockets are encoded via Protobuf <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf" target="_blank">git</a>, this should save bytes.  If each message is just a packet type and a fairly short string, this step doesn't add any value.  </li>
    <li>When you need concurrent communication with &gt;10,000 parties, it's important to look at “the first mile” of networking, or the traffic will be queued up “at your front door” (ie near to the server in networking terms).   This is out of scope for this article.   The consideration will be short if your service lives in a retail Cloud.   An article with nice diagrams for scaling <sup><a href="https://tsh.io/blog/how-to-scale-websocket/" target="_blank">25</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>A RnD project to operate 1,000,000 Websockets in a Node process <a href="https://github.com/ramsicandra/1million-ws" target="_blank">git</a>.  This is scaled via Docker to support the necessary number of IP ports, and RAM via Clouds machines.   NOTE: A cunning person with the root account could load multiple IP interfaces on a single ETH card, and sidestep the efficiency loss of a whole VM.  Also add multiple network cards.  </li>
    <li>Contriwise to above steps, large scale problems (ie 10,000,000 connections) should be in a single process outside of the kernel where possible <sup><a href="https://highscalability.com/the-secret-to-10-million-concurrent-connections-the-kernel-i/" target="_blank">26</a></sup> ~ this is also what Oracle inc decided in the '90s. </li>
    <li><i>ASIDE</i> Some articles describe connection pools eg <a href="https://github.com/derhuerst/websocket-pool" target="_blank">git</a> <sup><a href="https://protobuf.dev/" target="_blank">27</a></sup>, but as each event has a directly assigned event handle, I do not see how this works.  In lower level languages, a connection pool is to reduce multiple event polling to a single loop and poll() call, so save CPU time.  If each event handler is separate, nothing is gained.   </li>
    <li><i>I think this list should be longer, but context free optimisations are valueless.</i></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > Test handling <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>A test-server for a known running URL, to test that libraries are installed correctly ` WSS://ws.postman-echo.com/raw `.   As an example for generic “not working”, use the variant without SSL, ie ` WS:// `.    There is GUI to look at transactions if this helps (ie HTTPS://).   </li>
    <li>Test clients that support Websockets <sup><a href="https://dev.to/therealmrmumba/top-10-websocket-testing-tools-for-real-time-apps-updated-2024-1egc" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://apidog.com/blog/websocket-testing-tools/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>  ~ more common than I was expecting.  Probably the easiest integration is to embed `wscat` <a href="https://wscat.dev/" target="_blank">docs</a> <a href="https://github.com/websockets/wscat/tree/master" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat" target="_blank">npm</a> in your normal unit-test process (when JS). </li>
    <li>Assuming complex behaviour by client side software (maybe an agent?), so there needs to be a test server to show he client behaves as expected.  I am unable find a “test server for websockets” library.   It should be affordable to make a static server that replays scripts via a Websocket (think `expect`, but outputting via the websocket)  </li>
    <li>Unit tests should be constructed to show requests and responses for the Websocket API, ideally isolated from the networking layer, so the test runs faster ~ using your normal test library setup. </li>
    <li>The ` tshark ` packet sniffer can be setup as <sup><a href="https://ask.wireshark.org/question/35302/displaying-websocket-traffic-content/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> to show traffic.  For HTTPS (likekly), follow <sup><a href="https://labex.io/tutorials/wireshark-filter-http-traffic-in-tshark-548928" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/noobosaurus-r3x/Cheat-sheets/blob/main/Tshark_CheatSheet.md" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.   For in-browser “firebug” debugging, this Chrome plugin looks useful <sup><a href="https://www.websocket-devtools.com/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://codoid.com/api-testing/how-to-test-websockets/" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.   This concept is strong as you can capture HTTP and websocket traffic concurrently.</li>
    <li>A liveness test is easy as long a your languages supports WSS, see `wscat` above as a reference (easy from Node).</li>
    <li>Performance tests should be created, looking at concurrency and transaction time.  Example, a service using overly-simple architecture and Node that is only fast with one client, has no value.  This could be easily created by ChatGPT etc.    </li>
    <li>For a “normal webservice” it is essential to test with over a 10,000 connections, as the socket is permanently in use per client.  Basic implementations will fail (note 10K).   There should be some test runs that report performance across the normal internet, as this is what your users will see and do.</li>
    <li>As a standalone URL tester, cURL can be extended to support Websockets.   See notes below </li>
</ul>

<p>Web GUI tools outside of firewalls, that are not linked to your test platform are of little value for unit-tests.  They can be used for exploration / debugging, assuming a publicly accessible copy of the work-under-test is present.  I would suggest a copy of `wscat` unless the work is mature enough to be accessible.</p>

<p>The standard release for cURL doesn't include WSS.  But it does make a good test tool.   As an open-source project, you compile it in.
