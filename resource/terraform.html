<p>This is a tool to manage infra state, eg a new App has 5 AWS Serverless processes, several S3 buckets, a stack of related domains, and stuff on Amplify.  Terraform can ingest your AWS account, then allow easy, atomic, controllable steps changes.  This can be applied to entire estates, in a much reliable fashion than humans driving the AWS web-portal.  Terraform can do perfect revert / deletes, which is important if you need to limit overspend ~ especially on tests.  <br />
The headline value of this tool is to be able to keep deployment process in the same source repo as the source deployed, example <sup><a href="https://github.com/a2f0/resume" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.   For <i>single vendor</i> solutions their own SDK can also be used e.g. <sup><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  It would be really nice if the differences between vendors were abstracted, but this only partially happened.   With Terraform, it is a smaller problem, and Terraform won't keep saying &quot;<i>use the</i> [advert laden] <i>GUI</i>&quot;.</p>




<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > TL;DR ~ minimal path  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>AFAICT, this is the minimal path to Terraform solutions:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>install via a package manager, I used snap</li>
    <li>I can't find many template projects, but try:<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><a href="https://github.com/a2f0/resume" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/futurice/terraform-examples" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/mdb/terraform-example/blob/master/terraform/main.tf" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/Azure/terraform/blob/master/quickstart/201-function-app/main.tf" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-terraform-resources/blob/main/main.tf" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/blob/master/examples/complete/main.tf" target="_blank">git</a></li>
        <li>Test these data schema items with `terraform validate` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate" target="_blank">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Build a simple vendor integration ~ this is normally only a few lines, and `terraform import` the vendor <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/state-import" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  Read the `terraform.tfstate` cache in a text editor.  <b>⚠ WARNING ⚠</b> Do not write to this file.   The <i>tfstate</i> file lists the <b>all the variables</b> for the particular provider you are using ~ it can be used for discovery.</li>
    <li>Populate a `terraform.tfvars` <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-tfvars" target="_blank">3</a></sup> with your current access secrets in .env files, password manager, cert manager, etc.   This is similar to the win16/DOS ini format.   Tell Git to ignore this file <sup><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Execute the config `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` </li>
</ul>

<p>The most useful basic commands are ~ see ` terraform -help ` OR <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-commands-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://dev.to/samnash/terraform-commands-cheat-sheet-36ij" target="_blank">6</a></sup> a cheetsheet <sup><a href="https://github.com/devops-cheat-sheets/terraform-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-commands-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">8</a></sup>  a walk-through <sup><a href="https://meriemterki.scribe.rip/how-to-manage-terraform-state-a-step-by-step-guide-b615bd6ee0de" target="_blank">9</a></sup>:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>terraform init ~~~~ With configs created, this adds any necessary drivers without much hassle</li>
    <li>terraform plan ~~~ Reports broken attribs and configs </li>
    <li>terraform apply ~~ Makes the plan happen</li>
    <li>terraform import ~ Evaluates the remote service settings so Terraform can see what is different to the local config. See state section.</li>
</ul>

<summary><h3>Recipes </h3></summary>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Simple recipe first, favour Perl / bash style '#' for 1 line comments <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, although Clang comment are supported.</li>
    <li>Also incredibly minimal recipe, keeping all the sensitive value data (i.e. access credentials) in a separate file, with intentional data handling rules, limits problems from an automated platform.   The secrecy of the other non-value data is much less specific, although the other files are not UI material.    Note the massive value being able to upgrade to the newest copy of the vendor API in a single atomic and pre-tested step <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-registry#spacelift-module-registryeloper.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/versions" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.   </li>
    <li>There is an easily discoverable registry for the Terraform plugins <sup><a href="https://mattias.engineer/blog/2024/terraform-registry/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-registry" target="_blank">4</a></sup> at <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/" target="_blank">registry</a>.  However this is not the only one, for example Spacelift <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-registry#spacelift-module-registry" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://docs.spacelift.io/getting-started" target="_blank">6</a></sup></li>
    <li>As IaC is still code, it needs test doctrine.   Guidance is <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/test" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-test" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, there is `terraform test`.   The basic unit tests are put in either  <i>.tftest.json</i> or <i>.tftest.hcl</i> files.   Advanced tests run inside Golang, and probably normal Go test tools.  Consider what is being tested, heuristic tests have the most value, e.g. Checkov <sup><a href="https://www.checkov.io/" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.   The basic unit-test to see if you filled in a config file correctly is another config file, and infinite recursion.   </li>
    <li>Some scripts are very OS dependant, so need to be restricted to some situations.  Terraform offers no “sniff the OS” feature at present <sup><a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/way-to-determine-what-os-terraform-is-running-on/25107" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, however the following hack can report “POSIX or win32” <sup><a href="https://www.tecracer.com/blog/2021/05/terraform-os-detection.html" target="_blank">11</a></sup> which covers needs in most cases.  There are several other less good solutions that catch an exposed detail of the OS architecture, but IMO this is the best choice.   A Mac, old Unix, or modern Linux can run a bash script which can do more detailed sniffing.   A win32 machine will not function without extra setup steps.   To have scripts for Mac <i>and</i> Linux, there may need to be run the script in /bin/sh see <sup><a href="https://dev.to/bphogan/use-modern-bash-shell-on-macos-22a6" target="_blank">12</a></sup>, but that shell can sniff and load /bin/bash is you would prefer bash 4+ features (linux/ unix).</li>
    <li>Terraform can be run as a shell, with `terraform console` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/console" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>There is no need for an Eslint plugin, as Terraform ships with a formatting tool: `terraform fmt` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt" target="_blank">14</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>There is a command to programmatically load files in Terraform <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/file" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://jhooq.com/terraform-load-data-from-input-file/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.   Note parsing must be manually set.</li>
    <li>The command `terraform import` copies remote config to the local Terraform node <sup><a href="https://terrateam.io/blog/terraform-import/" target="_blank">17</a></sup>.   This allows comparison requirements to work better. </li>
    <li>Terraform <i>can</i> be used to create files on the local machine <sup><a href="https://www.boroscsaba.com/posts/run-terraform-locally-to-create-local-files/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.   This in some situations is a good way to create them, as it can automatically tidy-up afterwards.   </li>
    <li>To list possible variables for a vendor, create a minimal but complete provider setup, then run `terraform import` <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@leslie.alldridge/import-existing-resources-into-terraform-and-generate-code-with-examples-3130a9cb781a" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.  This will make a `terraform.tfstate` cache, which can be read in a text editor.  The variable names can be copied out of this cache.  </li>
    <li>How this declarative language deals with loops <sup><a href="https://www.gruntwork.io/blog/terraform-tips-tricks-loops-if-statements-and-gotchas" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.  Loops are too useful not to be included.   </li>
    <li>This tool will automate Oracle tools, which makes it worth using in its own right.   Oracle UI is heavy and authoritarian ~ it tells you to enter postcodes in caps with a dedicated message, rather than shifting-case in software.  </li>
    <li>There is a separate package called “Terraform Enterprise”, which I guess is to manage private cloud? </li>
    <li>Via automagic, create a self-signed cert for unit-tests <sup><a href="https://www.slingacademy.com/article/terraform-how-to-generate-self-signed-ssl-certificates/" target="_blank">21</a></sup>, or make one via Lets-Encrypt <sup><a href="https://blog.xmi.fr/posts/tls-terraform-azure-lets-encrypt/#level-2-requesting-a-certificate-from-lets-encrypt" target="_blank">22</a></sup>.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Extra cert details <sup><a href="https://amod-kadam.scribe.rip/create-private-ca-and-certificates-using-terraform-4b0be8d1e86d" target="_blank">23</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>There are a couple of integrations that allow Terraform on other Cert resellers ~ see the registry <sup><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Terraform has parsers / ingesters for common formats: JSON as `jsondecode` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsondecode" target="_blank">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@sampark02/mastering-jsonencode-and-jsondecode-in-terraform-f1406fc0ed03" target="_blank">26</a></sup>, CSV as `csvdecode` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/csvdecode" target="_blank">27</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.slingacademy.com/article/terraform-read-csv-data-and-convert-into-list-of-maps/" target="_blank">28</a></sup>, YML as `yamldecode` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/yamldecode" target="_blank">29</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://build5nines.com/working-with-yaml-in-terraform-using-the-yamldecode-and-yamlencode-functions/" target="_blank">30</a></sup>, base64 as `base64decode` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/base64decode" target="_blank">31</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://devtodevops.com/terraform-base64-encode/" target="_blank">32</a></sup>, and int `parseint` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/parseint" target="_blank">33</a></sup>.  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>There are complementary encode functions with predictable naming...</li>
        <li>Config files are normally held as the INI / default format, but can be stored as JSON <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/json" target="_blank">34</a></sup></li>
        <li>For base64, care will be needed for end-of-blocks <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78732942/terraform-base64encode-multiline" target="_blank">35</a></sup></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Data can be manipulated into and out of arrays `flatten` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/flatten" target="_blank">36</a></sup>, `distinct` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/distinct" target="_blank">37</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@sampark02/terraform-functions-flatten-and-distinct-explained-with-examples-cdb61a0c7406" target="_blank">38</a></sup>  or `map` <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/map" target="_blank">39</a></sup></li>
    <li>There is a list of string manipulation functions <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@sampark02/terraform-string-functions-real-world-examples-with-output-64a15207cc5b" target="_blank">40</a></sup> that resembles the JS String module.</li>
    <li>As described in the shorter text, `terraform plan` will list differences between the known server state and the local configs, there is <i>-destroy</i> and <i>-refresh-only</i> for DELETE and UPDATE actions <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan#planning-modes" target="_blank">41</a></sup>.   These later life-cycle operations are in more recent editions of Terraform, update it if needed for newer vendor API and newer features.   Whilst creating a large environment, better performance can be achieved with <i>-parallelism=n</i> , the default is 10. </li>
    <li>By default Terraform attempts to confirm actions that may have side-effects whilst <i>applying</i>.  This is not great for automation, and can be disabled <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply#apply-options" target="_blank">42</a></sup>.   Passing in a particular plan files implies that you are confident in its contents, and will also disable the confirm steps.</li>
    <li>I have worked with contractors in more rural areas of India / Pakistan / Bengal who dislike Github / Bitbucket as it saturates their connection for hours (their office to the vendors servers, probably in the US).   However if they had a Git server on a cloud based in India, that should be a reasonable performance, and transit for cloud-to-cloud should be a lot more reliable.   Uploading a Terraform plan file should be really efficient in bytes (office to a Git server), so not have this penalty.   For test deployments, a <i>near cloud</i> is a much better workflow.  The difference for “oh, no! Its slow” of a few seconds (me) vs several hours (them) is noticeable.</li>
    <li>It's possible to add extra checks and external scripts, like cost estimators as a validation step <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/validation-enforcement" target="_blank">43</a></sup>.   This feels more like an interactive BDD test.</li>
    <li>As an example of “scripting on-host resources”, Terraform can setup Nginx <sup><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/getstackhead/nginx/latest" target="_blank">44</a></sup> <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/getstackhead/nginx/latest/docs" target="_blank">docs</a>.  Using Terraform for the same computer is an odd thing to do, but it's possible.   Also a recipe to deploy Nginx to previous generation whole-VM-machine cloud <sup><a href="https://dev.to/danielfavour/deploy-an-nginx-web-server-on-an-ec2-instance-with-terraform-621" target="_blank">45</a></sup>, and how to deploy a pre-setup Docker image to your local machine via Terraform (running, guess what? .... Nginx!).   </li>
    <li>There is a plugin for Redhat <a href="https://github.com/orgs/terraform-redhat/repositories" target="_blank">git</a> or official <sup><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/redhat-developer/rhoas/latest/docs" target="_blank">46</a></sup>.  I haven't checked other distros, but I assume the same would be possible ~ a press release <sup><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/new-terraform-integrations-with-cisco-dell-red-hat-servicenow-and-more" target="_blank">47</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>To setup mail relay on the above new RHEL server, I think it's necessary to use Ansible, or plain bash, these can be triggered from the same Terraform transaction.   There is a terraform-ansible plugin <sup><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ansible/ansible/latest" target="_blank">48</a></sup> <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ansible/ansible/latest/docs" target="_blank">docs</a> <a href="https://github.com/ansible/terraform-provider-ansible" target="_blank">git</a>.</li>
    <li>There are firewall plugins for cloud, but can't find one for RHEL directly.</li>
    <li>There are quite a few plugins for routing <sup><a href="https://registry.terraform.io/search/providers?category=networking&amp;amp;q=%20networking" target="_blank">49</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>For locked networking work-spaces, it is possible to use local plugins, rather than download from the vendor <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50944395/use-pre-installed-terraform-plugins-instead-of-downloading-them-with-terraform-i" target="_blank">50</a></sup>, as the link says, there is a cache-dir option, and a bundle option.</li>
</ul>

<summary><h3>Data 'sump' </h3></summary>

<p>After everal days reading about Terraform, I am dumping data here before I forget it.  I labelled this section a sump, as the data is just seeping in, and it's less structured.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>It builds a map of currently known settings to act as a comparison point to the input config.  This 'source of truth' is used for comparing what changes to make.</li>
    <li>The configs for Terraform could be written as a much more simple Bash script.  But Terraform has more scalability, repeatability, revertability, and data integrity features <i>so is better</i>.  </li>
    <li>A Terraform instance should include: config files <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files" target="_blank">1</a></sup> holding schema type declarations <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/terraform" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, config files holding variables <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables" target="_blank">3</a></sup> and sensitive variables that need better security practices <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#ephemeral-avoid-storing-values-in-state-or-plan-files" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#suppressing-values-in-cli-output" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.   Official security practice <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/security/security-sensitive-data" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  Off the top of my head, define the sensitive variables so there is less access to them e.g. file permission + hidden files.  Options are discussed <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3830823/hiding-secret-from-command-line-parameter-on-unix" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/298178/hide-arguments-of-commands-in-ps" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.  Data isn't secret when set in a bash environment, but it is convenient if many different processes need the same value <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/environment-variables" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.   </li>
    <li>A list of block types used the config files are <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@pankajkumar1881991/types-of-block-and-its-usage-in-terraform-a4bb0de772c4" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-of-blocks-in-terraform/" target="_blank">11</a></sup>: <i>Terraform</i> Block, <i>Provider</i> Block, <i>Data</i> Block, <i>Resource</i> Block, <i>Module</i> Block, <i>Variable</i> Block, <i>Output</i> Block, <i>Locals</i> Block.   I was expecting that plugins would extend this list for extra purposes, but haven't seen this.  Unlike Clang family languages, blocks have a structure of a type, a name and the contained sub-structures.  Ignoring white-space, like the following<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>`provider “aws” { region = “us-west-2” }` </li>
        <li>There can be multiple name-sections, and they need to be quoted.  </li>
        <li>Each Block can have multiple name segments, if this helps readability eg</li>
        <li>`provider “aws” “USregion” { region = “us-west-2” }` </li>
        <li>`provider “aws” “EUregion” { region = “eu-south-1” }` </li>
        <li>IMO each block an be modelled as a static function call, with named arguments <i>à la</i> Perl, not array offset arguments <i>à la</i> Assembly </li>
        <li>`provider “aws” “EUregion” { region = “eu-south-1” }` =&gt;  `provider.aws_EUregion( region = “eu-south-1” ) `</li>
        <li>I suspect (didn't look) that these TF files are compiled into Golang modules, see auto-code structures like GraphQL, Storybook configs or SOAP clients as older examples of auto-code. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The stated best practice <sup><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/9-extraordinary-terraform-best-practices/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/best-practices-for-iac-and-spacelift" target="_blank">13</a></sup> for Terraform config in 2025 is to group the block types in files like “JS functional programming”.   So a file for <i>Providers</i>, a file for <i>Outputs</i> etc.  They call this a 'module' file, but the module header is optional.   </li>
    <li>There is a <i>module</i> block <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/syntax" target="_blank">14</a></sup>, which declares the meta data for the module.  This can be mostly a “source” keyword to a known good TF config in github, a random git server <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#generic-git-repository" target="_blank">15</a></sup> or plain URL <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>If a module needs a structure, but doesn't copy it, Terraform also includes “depends_on” feature <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on" target="_blank">17</a></sup></li>
    <li>Officially, Terraform only runs on Linux <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/requirements/os-specific/supported-os" target="_blank">18</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.   It has been observed on win32 correctly <sup><a href="https://dev.to/annysah/step-by-step-guide-to-installing-terraform-on-windows-m2e" target="_blank">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@morsi.masmoudi/a-beginners-guide-to-installing-terraform-on-windows-9321e566893d" target="_blank">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://jeffbrown.tech/install-terraform-windows/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>.   PG has a similar policy.    </li>
    <li>Some of the more complex structures add what looks like an adhoc JS Object, the Terraform's type system calls this a <i>Dynamic block</i> <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/dynamic-blocks" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-dynamic-blocks#what-are-terraform-dynamic-blocks" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.   A dynamic block should include a label, for_each, iterator (optional), and content elements.</li>
    <li>The precedence for data sources <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@mehmetodabashi/terraform-variable-usage-the-order-of-precedence-for-variable-sources-c91586ddb13f" target="_blank">25</a></sup></li>
    <li>NOTE: using Terraform is fairly easy for the larger providers which are widely documented.</li>
    <li>About the plugin framework <sup><a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework" target="_blank">26</a></sup>.   There is a tool to make docs as a plugin <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs" target="_blank">git</a>.</li>
    <li>If I read the advertising correctly, the “official” version of Terraform includes “hosting your terraform config” <sup><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/terraform" target="_blank">27</a></sup> as another dedicated computational cloud like AWS Lambda.   I haven't used this, it's out of scope for me.</li>
