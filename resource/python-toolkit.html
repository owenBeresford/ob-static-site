<p>This is a part of a quick range of “preferred tools” articles, setting up server-side languages.   This will need to updated in 2-3 years.    #boring I'm starting to think I should add a snoring backtrack to these pages.   I do not have a “project starter” project/ scripts for Python the way I do for TS/ JS projects.   So notes are here, as plan B...</p>


<h5 id="toc0"> Language target</h5>
<p>The newest stable edition of Python is clearly the best one to use.    I am eager to use v3.12 or greater.   The Python team thinks v3.12 is useful, and have published it <sup><a href="https://devguide.python.org/versions/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  <strong>UPDATE August 2024</strong>: the Ubuntu team have released this edition now.   I can access this on my desktop OS <sup><a href="https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2023/05/install-python-3-12-ubuntu/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.linuxcapable.com/install-python-3-12-on-ubuntu-linux/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   If an employer uses Fedora clones, I can use the newer version <sup><a href="https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/python3.12/python3.12/index.html" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, or general Redhat clones <sup><a href="https://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=python3.12" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.    I can use it in AWS serverless <sup><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/python-3-12-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, and GCP serverless <sup><a href="https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/supported-python-versions" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.   As Win32 doesn't ship with any dev languages, it automatically doesn't support a version for Python.   However it has be installed, as a non-versioned service <sup><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.   Azure has Python support, but no specific version <sup><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/get-started?tabs=cmd" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.<br />
I have used Python venv() previously <sup><a href="https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, <del>but I have no idea how much they are used on non-shared servers (i.e. middleware version + OS package version + my work version).</del> UPDATE: it seems since Python2 was entirely removed, they want every local dev to have their own vEnv(), so [linux] system functionality can't be broken as the dev installed a package to play with.  I noticed this in Ubuntu 24, but it may have been policy on other OS earlier. See vEnv script at end of article if nonplussed.<br />
Just before I got my first real job (i.e. same week), I read an article about Stackless, and how this had high levels of concurrency.   Stackless is a version of the Python interpreter that has no C type stack <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackless_Python" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki" target="_blank">git</a>.   I have not yet been in a position to use this language, but as Python devs are more common than Elixir or Golang devs, I would be keen for a useful benchmark comparing them <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220645/what-would-i-use-stackless-python-for" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.   This paragraph is inspired by the benchmark in languages group article with Elixir (note Elixir used <i>all the CPU cycles</i>, but delivered a large amount of outputs.  I think stackless would behave like that, but on fewer vCPU, with extremely high clock rates).</p>


<h5 id="toc1"> Contracts/ Headers/ Interfaces</h5>
<p>Current Python does have a Header structure, but doesn't call them this.   They are delegated to mypy helper tool (included in default release), and it calls them Stub files <sup><a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html#stub-files" target="_blank">14</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.   There is a project like TS &quot;@types” namespace and thid project is called “typeshed” <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed" target="_blank">git</a> (note, in the python project).   Types projects are normally named “types-XXX”.  <br />
To make stub files without effort, run the following.  There are many other tools that can achieve this result.   <br />
`stubgen --include-docstrings $FILES`<br />
Optionally add `-o $PATH` to set where to put created files.  I cannot find any notes for best location of the header files. <br />
The largest liability compared to other languages, is that I cannot see a means to have multiple implementations per stub/ contract.<br />
In your normal Python project you can add a <i>mypy.ini</i> <sup><a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.danielnazarian.com/blog/posts/d8c0b95a-40dd-4eb5-99a8-182d2595e459/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> to store location of <i>pyi</i> files (and details), so they are useful.</p>


<h5 id="toc2"> Class Path patching</h5>
<p>There is a feature to have local projects in the class path: Python includes “site-packages” <sup><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, and it existed in Py2 <sup><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.   This is still iterating.   Make a <i>.pth</i> file in a relevant directory, and Python will use your code transparently, without drama.  This following admin needs to be run <i>per interpreter</i>:<br />
<code lang="bash" class="highlight">
python -m site --user-site   # will print the relevant 
				# directory
which python # use this to check the default interpreter
				# is what you wanted
echo "/path/to/your/directory" \
> $(python -m site --user-site)/mylibrary.pth`
# Assuming you are in the relevant directory initially, 
				# this can be:
pwd > $(python -m site --user-site)/mylibrary.pth

</code></p>

<p>I did not find feature this is docs in preceding years.   Note this induces chaos if your OS package manager changes version of Python.</p>


<h5 id="toc3"> Tools</h5>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>An IDE, [sorry for all the jetbrains adverts] Pycharm, Thonny, Sublime or VScode.  Packages from your standard OS package manager.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>IDE plugins...</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>An online REPL <a href="https://python-fiddle.com/" target="_blank">fiddle</a>, if you are on a win32 machine with no interpreter locally. </li>
    <li>package lists via <a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">pypi</a> <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/" target="_blank">docs</a></li>
    <li>As this is for recent Python, just use pip3 to install (it works more reliably than each older option).  Pip3 supports 'version logic', i.e. `somepackage==1.0.4`, or `somePackage&gt;=2.4` <sup><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" target="_blank">20</a></sup>, just like other languages.   Python packages have less name drift to the normal use name, compared to npm, so I am not wasting your time with install statements.   To use `pip3` without root follow <sup><a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/445906/how-to-get-pip3-without-sudo-privileges" target="_blank">21</a></sup></li>
    <li>Run `pip3 install -r python-dev-env.text --user` where the text file is from <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/oab1-conf/blob/main/python-dev-env.text" target="_blank">git</a></li>
    <li>unit test: <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>pytest (better assert features) <a href="https://docs.pytest.org" target="_blank">docs</a> <sup><a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/pytest-vs-unittest" target="_blank">22</a></sup>  </li>
        <li>unittest (a default install) <sup><a href="https://ianhopkinson.org.uk/2020/11/unit-testing-in-python-using-the-unittest-module/" target="_blank">23</a></sup> </li>
        <li>The above meet my current needs, however if I needed to test a complex feature, and I had manoeuvring room, I would to to create php-skelgen syntax for Python.  As Python has good reflection support this should be a 3-4day hack.   </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>prettier / auto-formatter<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Do not install the tool “prettier”, as it just does JSON and YML not PY files.</li>
        <li>Black <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">docs</a> <sup><a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/" target="_blank">24</a></sup> is quite useful, setting the line length to 120char, is the only config I changed,</li>
        <li>YAPF <sup><a href="https://www.kevinpeters.net/auto-formatters-for-python" target="_blank">25</a></sup></li>
        <li>autopep8</li>
        <li>isort - Black doesn't put imports in Python preferred order, I use lsort to set these.   It is major waste of time for a human to do trivia like that manually.   </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>lint: <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Pyrfecter <a href="https://pyrfecter.com" target="_blank">docs</a> ~ I can't find how to install this as a local service.</li>
        <li>Pylint <a href="https://www.pylint.org/" target="_blank">docs</a>  cheetsheet <sup><a href="https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/python/project-administration/linting/pylint.html" target="_blank">26</a></sup> ~ this needs details to be useful, just like Eslint.  Run it after the prettier tool, to reduce noisy whining.   IMO, the results of this tool are a guide, not an authority (a PO may think differently).   NOTICE: ASAP upgrade to <i>pylint 4.10</i> to add checking on typehints (no release date at time of print) <a href="https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3853" target="_blank">git</a>.  </li>
        <li>There is a static analysis project, mypy <sup><a href="https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/#static-type-checking" target="_blank">27</a></sup> <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">docs</a> a cheatsheet <sup><a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html" target="_blank">28</a></sup> for today this delivers type hint validation.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>docs generator:<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Python ships with pydoc module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html" target="_blank">docs</a>.  An article on docs features built into younger versions of Python <sup><a href="https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#commenting-code-via-type-hinting-python-35" target="_blank">29</a></sup></li>
        <li>Apparently, Swagger can be used on Python API <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/blueriders/python-autogenerated-documentation-3-tools-that-will-help-document-your-project-c6d7623814ef" target="_blank">30</a></sup></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Python doesn't need a compiler, however better performance can be chased with <sup><a href="https://hackr.io/blog/best-python-compilers" target="_blank">31</a></sup>.   The project page for Numba <sup><a href="https://numba.pydata.org/" target="_blank">32</a></sup> claims it approaches the speed of C or Fortran, just be using Decorators in Python3 code (I guess this means its a link-library in C).  Numba is targeting numerical computation tasks. </li>
    <li>For the modern versions of Python, using vEnv() is required for normal users, please see sample at end.  This can be wrapped in another tool, like PipEnv ~ next point.</li>
    <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I see pipenv <sup><a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">33</a></sup> <a href="https://docs.pipenv.org/" target="_blank">docs</a> quote: Pipenv is a Python virtualenv management tool that supports a multitude of systems and nicely bridges the gaps between pip, python (using system python, pyenv or asdf) and virtualenv. Linux, macOS, and Windows are all first-class citizens in pipenv.  </li>
    <li>Making a `requirements.txt`, like above is a good minimal version of a package wrapper.   Common deploy process <sup><a href="https://www.nylas.com/blog/packaging-deploying-python/" target="_blank">34</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/deployment.html" target="_blank">35</a></sup>, a basic tut <sup><a href="https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/" target="_blank">36</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/automatically-build-and-deploy-your-python-application-in-4-easy-steps-88084fc07d54" target="_blank">37</a></sup>.   I need to revise this bullet, there are <i>many tools</i> in the last 17 years for deployments, I should limit this down to the good ones.   UPDATE: I discover a `pyproject.toml` convention for a manifest <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/" target="_blank">docs</a> <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/better-programming/a-pyproject-toml-developers-cheat-sheet-5782801fb3ed" target="_blank">38</a></sup>, the file format is <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML" target="_blank">39</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>For prototyping, <i>streamlit</i> ~ name as listed in pipy ~ <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started" target="_blank">docs</a> <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference" target="_blank">docs</a> <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit" target="_blank">git</a> looks like a good tool.  This line will be updated after use.</li>
    <li>Profilers, the builtin cProfile and profile <sup><a href="https://realpython.com/python-profiling/" target="_blank">40</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html" target="_blank">41</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/python-profiling-why-and-where-your-code-is-slow-d6f41601dba8" target="_blank">42</a></sup>, there are a list of tools mentioned in <sup><a href="https://scribe.rip/@saurav.kr.paul/5-python-profiling-tools-for-performance-analysis-17fa245324cd" target="_blank">43</a></sup>, you can easily check what your system ships with via `pydoc3 -k profile` and Linux user are always told to use `kcachegrind`.</li>

<summary>To create a local Python for development</summary>
<code lang="bash" class="highlight">
