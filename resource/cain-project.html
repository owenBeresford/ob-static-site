<p>Following my MSc, I assisted a psychology PhD student with the technical aspects to her thesis.   Her work was to analyse means to improve the internet for people with disabilities.   As high level summary, add an extra level of search filtering to Google results (unfortunately before the Google API was released) so the many thousands of pages would be practically reduced to a short list people could actually use.   I was employed before I could complete the work on this, although source is available.  <br />
This project was written to be seen by others rather than to explore ideas so I was writing structural documentation from the start.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Improve the internet as a research tool, by lowering the barriers to entry;</li>
    <li>Setup a service to implement the above point;</li>
    <li>Explore ideas relating to perception and individualised workstations;</li>
    <li>Ensure the service is adaptive, so the user and the <strong>current</strong> conditions are supported (lighting specifically);</li>
    <li>Allow a post-graduate student to get a PhD;</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to add Javascript interpretation to this list, as pages frequently use that language to alter the appearance of web pages.  At the point of contact, I didn't have an interpreter.</p>

<hr />
<p>Update: by 2013, now there is a more mature open-source market, and something could probably be achieved via spidermonkey, node.js or similar; for interpreting JS.  It would still be computationally hard, to know exactly what a section of JS did without running it.</p>

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > Implementation of website <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I was capable of web development, my co-workers where not, so I mocked up a static interface prototype.  This was to work out use-case requirements on this service.  The prototype was strict HTML4.01 with good use of CSS.<br />
I was intending to make a “live” one after the script engine was completed so activity was possible.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc5"> <a href="#toc5" title="Jump to this section." > Implementation overview and context <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>At the time of doing this work, I was an academic and wrote introduction to my aspect of CAIN.  This is <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/cain-introduction#">here</a>, but note it is a <del>seven</del><ins>ten</ins> year old document, some of the references may not function.</p>

<p>I was intending to help a fellow student, not sell a product, and was expecting the work to be continued by other parties.  As such the code needed clear design, compliance to University habits, architecture documentation as well as code documentation.   Lastly to be used by my co-worker to make it operational, I needed administrator documentation.  All of which need to coherent with the code base and the current requirements.  As such, the <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk//external/cain-grammar.html" target="_blank">grammar I choose</a> is documented, a <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk//external/CAIN.v2.idl" target="_blank">basic IDL</a> is documented, I presented <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/cain-introduction#">reasoned arguments about features</a><br />
One of my activities was a twenty minute presentation on how I was building my colleges research theories.  This I did much more smoothly than my own MSc presentation.</p>

<p>I pulled a few references out, you may find them useful:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk//external/cain-grammar.html" target="_blank">CAIN Grammar</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk//external/html-interpretation.html" target="_blank">HTML Interpretation</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk//external/tree-references.html" target="_blank">Tree References</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is more documentation, but it wasn't recoverable.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc6"> <a href="#toc6" title="Jump to this section." > Technical requirements <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>In-order to use CAIN script, Perl5 and the following Perl libs must be installed:<br />
<strong>cain_version=1.1.0</strong></p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Bundle::BDI     - or some similar BDI package</li>
    <li>Bundle::LWP     </li>
    <li>Data::Dumper    - should already be installed</li>
    <li>Sys::Hostname</li>
    <li>HTML::Parser    - part of LWP I think</li>
    <li>Net::Ping</li>
    <li>File::Spec</li>
    <li>Getopt::Mixed</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc7"> <a href="#toc7" title="Jump to this section." > Remaining TODO <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Todo list as of 2004-06-28, please note numbers aren't sequential I have done some of these.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><strong>[1b]</strong> Force the tree structure to get passed around correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>[6]</strong>  Other than interface design, I have done <em>no work</em> on the front end. DONE BY JOHN</li>
    <li><strong>[7]</strong>  Have no thorough version for the user manual.</li>
    <li><strong>[8]</strong>  SemanticFilter is not thorough enough yet (the execing functionality has little error checking as the responsibility is delegated to the SemanticFilter).</li>
    <li><strong>[10]</strong> Assuming all previous done, some real world testing.</li>
    <li><strong>[11]</strong> Tidy up the documentation, as it is not finished.</li>
    <li><strong>[99]</strong> All other details that spontaneously appear.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc8"> <a href="#toc8" title="Jump to this section." > Install notes  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Install notes for the development bundle of CAINscript</p>

<p>1) Email me for the source bundle file. This is a dead project, and I have removed it from public source directories.<br />
put the file in your home</p>

<p>2) decompress it<br />
` tar -xzf ./cain-script-dev.tar.gz `</p>

<p>3) copy the wrapper to a directory on you path<br />
<code class="highlight wide" lang="bash">chmod 755 ~/cain/cain
chmod 755 ~/cain/Tester.pl
chmod 755 ~/cain/Main.pl
cp ~/cain/cain $some_directory_on_your_path
</code></p>

<p>4) ensure you have a recent version of perl<br />
` perl -v `</p>

<p>5) use CPAN or similar to install required libraries<br />
(these are listed in requirements.txt)<br />
to use CPAN: <br />
` perl -MCPAN -e shell`</p>

<p>6) cd ~/cain</p>

<p>7) the database tests use a some test stuff in the database.<br />
the host, password etc, are controlled via the cain.conf<br />
anyway the tests read and write to a table called test2 as described:<br />
<code class="highlight" lang="sql">mysql> use cain
-- Reading table information for completion of table and column names
-- You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

-- Database changed
mysql> show tables;
 +----------------+
 | Tables_in_cain |
 +----------------+
 | test2          |
 +----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> desc test2;
 +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
 +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
 | uid   | int(11)     |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
 | str   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
 +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> 
</code></p>

<p>8) make any edits, <br />
run it with the wrapper script (the one called 'cain', that you put on your <br />
path)<br />
the wrapper script redirects the debugging output (on STDOUT) to ~/cain/cain.out</p>

<p>There a small number of sample scripts in the 'ts' directory<br />
the interface prototype from alice is in the 'web' directory</p>
