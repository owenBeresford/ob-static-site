<p>Boring product comparison article.   I don't think the derivative metric “cash value per page” is useful, as its mixing multiple items of data together; and is very ignorant about people's thinking.   Many marketing people think “cash per page” is very important feature of google analytics.   There are also quite a few pages on the internet saying that “convenience of delivery is very valuable to millennials”.   Example of why I don't value the metric: “shipping page/ interaction”, is not a revenue earner; but needs to be present in some fashion.   If I can't get goods delivered to me, I won't click <i>“BUY!&quot;</i>; if the postage fees make up a large proportion of the purchases value, I will think carefully about other ways to get the goods.</p>

<p>IMO the data to deliver to the business should be: time spent on service; user population churn; user population growth; what feature received most attention; wishes/complaints feedback; feature load speed; odd user interactions (like clicking on inert elements).  Data to deliver to the dev team involves “dead clicks”, excessive scrolling, JS crashes, 404 errors (frequently these are third party); I would like to report colour contrast and font readability and feature load times.</p>

<p>This market seems to be segregating itself into “established players” and “product analytics”, maybe I should split this into two articles.</p>

    <li><strong><a href="https://www.smartlook.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Smartlook</a></strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Smartlook is very focussed on mobile <sup><a href="https://www.smartlook.com/mobile-analytics/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, they also support heatmaps, event recording, user journeys,  sales funnels <sup><a href="https://reviews.financesonline.com/p/smartlook/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.   There is documentation for ionic mobile framework <sup><a href="https://docs.smartlook.com/docs/sdk/ionic/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  They also public an API for integrating into your apps <sup><a href="https://docs.smartlook.com/docs/sdk/api-reference?platform=android" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  The culture expressed by this company is very different from Plerdy.   They have been bought by Cisco </li>
        <li>Smartlook specifin important utility to make the UI communicate with users clearly [].    My reference this analytical point is <sup><a href="https://aycl.uie.com/topics/scent_of_information" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://aycl.uie.com/virtual_seminars/the_scent_of_information_getting_users_to_their_content" target="_blank">6</a></sup> </li>
        <li>Smartlook doesn't mention lossy or lossless recording; therefore I assume lossless. Smartlook support a range of export options <sup><a href="https://help.smartlook.com/docs/reports" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.smartlook.com/blog/raw-event-data-csv-export/" target="_blank">8</a></sup></li>
        <li>Smartlook can record a range of events <sup><a href="https://www.smartlook.com/events/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://help.smartlook.com/docs/events" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, but they down-play graphing of these at the end; aside from heatmaps.  </li>
        <li>Smartlook inbound advertising/ blogs position the company as optimised to record every session for every user <sup><a href="https://www.smartlook.com/blog/record-website-visitors/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/blog/hotjar-vs-smartlook/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong> <a href="https://www.inspectlet.com" target="_blank">Inspectlet</a> </strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Does eye tracking <sup><a href="https://www.inspectlet.com/feature/heatmaps" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, which is why I mention the tool.  Inspectlet also does session recording, A/B testing, feedback surveys, form analytics and error logging <sup><a href="https://www.inspectlet.com/feature/heatmaps" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>Eye-tracking should be applicable to any device; as it is external to the hardware.  Note that smaller motions on smaller screens will be harder to track.  </li>
        <li>There are graphs as part of the dashboard <sup><a href="https://www.inspectlet.com/docs" target="_blank">15</a></sup></li>
        <li>There is no mention of lossy or lossless recording; so I would assume lossless by default.  The native storage length depends on contract type; but data can be downloaded <sup><a href="https://docs.inspectlet.com/hc/en-us/articles/219801148-How-long-does-Inspectlet-keep-data" target="_blank">16</a></sup>. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://posthog.com/pricing" target="_blank">PostHog</a> </strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>is a company and an open-source project, it incorporates many older platform features.  They describes themselves a product analytics, not web analytics.  </li>
        <li>This is like a more modern and flexible version of Google analytics, you can store 50 site specific data points per log transaction.  They seem to use many data attributes in HTML.</li>
        <li>Android <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/tutorials/android-analytics" target="_blank">17</a></sup> and iPhone <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/tutorials/ios-analytics" target="_blank">18</a></sup> mobile can be logged, event tracking notes <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/tutorials/event-tracking-guide" target="_blank">19</a></sup></li>
        <li>PostHog supports self hosting, so they have no need to lossy recording <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/docs/self-host" target="_blank">20</a></sup>. </li>
        <li>PostHog supports heatmaps <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/docs/toolbar/heatmaps" target="_blank">21</a></sup> and many other types of graph</li>
        <li>There are some ideas for data ingestion <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse/setup/snowflake" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/2904" target="_blank">23</a></sup>.  Exporting data is a mature feature though <sup><a href="https://posthog.com/docs/cdp/batch-exports" target="_blank">24</a></sup></li>
        <li>the price model in the first link is clear, and I hope complete.  Again: note the self hosting option.</li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Hotjar</a></strong> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I bumped into hotjar in 2002, this is a long-lived brand/company.</li>
        <li>Adverts are all focussed on heatmaps <sup><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/heatmaps/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> for the last 20 years.</li>
        <li>It supports eye tracking <sup><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/conversion-rate-optimization/glossary/eye-tracking/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, which against most of the market is a killer feature; and inline user surveys.  Hotjar and most the market record mouse-events which is technically easier.  Most of the texts say hotjar reads mouseevents, and also doesn't support mobile (content published in 2019 and 2020); however <sup><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/website-tracking/tools/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> now says it supports tap and scroll events in addition. </li>
        <li>Hotjar says it can keep data for a year; and in-aggregate captures all mouseevents <sup><a href="https://www.fullsession.io/blog/hotjar-review/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>UX analysis is more critical for resource-constrained mobile apps, they are tested alot; but hotjar doesn't support mobile <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-Hotjar-support-mobile-apps" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>Hotjar supports export of recorded session; but I couldn't find any import option <sup><a href="https://www.hotjar.com/updates/en/-new-in-recordings-export-lists-with-metadata" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>They seem to support reasonable scale of capture [XXX], and I can't find any mention of lossiness. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://app.datadoghq.eu/billing/plan" target="_blank">Datadog</a></strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Covers infrastructure <sup><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/infrastructure-monitoring/" target="_blank">7</a></sup> + event tracking + user tracking <sup><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/session-replay-datadog/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> + derivative metrics.</li>
        <li>The RUM (user tracking) logs <sup><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> what a user is doing in their browser.</li>
        <li>Has an agent for a browser <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/datadog-client" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, and/ or agent on server (for each server that you use) <sup><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/community/libraries/" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.   It can capture data from mobile apps <sup><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-mobile-rum/" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>Has a heat map plugin <sup><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/widgets/heat_map/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, and various graphs in the dashboards <sup><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>Has lossless data recording, but they bill you per month of data stored <sup><a href="https://app.datadoghq.eu/billing/plan" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.   Historically Datadog billed per-server it was installed on; however I think they do not do that anymore.</li>
        <li>Datadog has an export feature <sup><a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/export/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Plerdy</a></strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>The main website is a well organised conversion funnel <sup><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://startuptalky.com/plerdy-review/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>, casually mentioning session replay, heatmaps, event tracking, NPS + sales performance, and conversion funnels.   Note search engines do not think this is major brand mark, as they also “correct” the name to “elderly”.</li>
        <li>Plerdy has heatmaps <sup><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/heatmap/" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.  Plerdy does not mention mobile in a useful fashion, so I guess is limited to desktop.  They do have several vacious articles defining terms; but never stating whether they support “user tracking on mobile” e.g. <sup><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/blog/web-usability-site-conversion-perfect-match-website-top/" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.  UPDATE: <sup><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/blog/click-tracker/" target="_blank">21</a></sup> does mention mobile.</li>
        <li>They do not mention lossy/ lossless anywhere that I can find; I would tend to assume lossless by default.</li>
        <li>One of the services that Plerdy offers is forms (like their competitors), and they offer export of this user data <sup><a href="https://www.plerdy.com/faq/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>.  Unlike Datadog they do not seem to support export of sessions.</li>
        <li>Companies like Plerdy are too slippery to list pricing for scale operations in a meaningful fashion; so I haven't looked. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://mixpanel.com/pricing" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a> </strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A good intro <sup><a href="https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/intro/" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/concepts" target="_blank">24</a></sup>, attributes <sup><a href="https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties" target="_blank">25</a></sup>.

        <li>There is no mention of lossy/ lossless, so I assume all data is kept.</li>
        <li>Mixpanel does not support heatmaps directly <sup><a href="https://mixpanel.com/blog/heat-map/" target="_blank">29</a></sup>, there are integration which deliver this feature <sup><a href="https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations" target="_blank">30</a></sup> customisations <sup><a href="https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/features/chart-customization" target="_blank">31</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>Data import is a mature features in Mixpanel <sup><a href="https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events" target="_blank">32</a></sup>, and data export <sup><a href="https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/raw-event-export" target="_blank">33</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://community.mixpanel.com/t/18847315/can-i-export-all-events-from-a-project" target="_blank">34</a></sup> </li>

    <li><strong><a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Clarity</a></strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Clarity is free, so no pricing link; it is Microsoft OSS <sup><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/clarity" target="_blank">37</a></sup>.  </li>
        <li>Clarity has heatmaps, session playback, and metrics visualisation as a dashboard <sup><a href="https://www.letmespeak.in/microsoft-clarity-and-its-features/" target="_blank">38</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">39</a></sup>.  From the way they emphasise those statements make it seem smaller/ less features than other applications.   It has integration to Wordpress.</li>
        <li>Clarity blogs say it supports user input from phone web apps <sup><a href="https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/november-2018/Introducing-Clarity-a-web-analytics-product" target="_blank">40</a></sup></li>
        <li>There is no visible mention of lossy vs lossless; so I assume it is lossless. </li>
        <li>The corporate blog <sup><a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/blog/clarity-now-supports-exporting/" target="_blank">41</a></sup> states that clarity recently gained the ability to export recordings.</li>

    <li><strong> <a href="https://sumo.com/pricing" target="_blank">Sumo</a></strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Please note there are several companies with similar names.  AFAIK, Sumo previously used the brand “king”, or “sumo king” or similar.  However, there is a separate company called “call sumo”, with a different colour scheme and logo <sup><a href="https://callsumo.com/enhancing-user-experience-call-tracking/" target="_blank">42</a></sup>, who track user experience.  Thirdly there is “Sumo logic”, who seem very similar tech to datadog <sup><a href="https://help.sumologic.com/Traces/Real_User_Monitoring" target="_blank">43</a></sup>.</li>
        <li>They broker many apps/ plugins <sup><a href="https://appsumo.com/browse" target="_blank">44</a></sup>.  Due to the confusion on product offering, I have moved this to last slot.</li>
        <li>In the 2015 edition, it supplied very detailed user tracking data. </li>
