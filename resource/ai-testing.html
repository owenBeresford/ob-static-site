<p>Testing LLM is an activity that I need to be able to do, but it isn't yet a strategy I have when I started writing.  If a chatbot is taking the role of a human, it should have the same responsibilities as a human.  Corporate legal depts have in some places tried to claim that as it's just software what it says isn't contractually binding <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  As a UX interaction, that implies they are firing their customer support dept, and replacing it with [ . . . ].   Nothing meaningful.   This would reduce costs, but, erm, may affect customer relationships.<br />
As a zeroth question, why do common LLM tech ingest and keep random and variable data?   LLMs shouldn't treat the whole of the internet as a single flat address space.   For non-AI pieces of software, it is common practice to discard useless data.  If there was a LLM with knowledge of $english, but <em>facts</em> were only taken from the knowledge base, yes the chatbot can't recite Shakespeare to you, but is that a limitation?   If the LLM doesn't reference the internet, it won't know “there are no countries in Africa that start with a K” (Kenya exists), is this a limitation?   If the LLM doesn't know how law cases happen in US TV dramas, which are just fictional, (so it reads real case histories, like legal staff are supposed to) is this a limitation?   If it doesn't know that people claim they stick cheese to pizza with glue, is that a limitation?   I write $english as you may want your chatbot to speak the local Swahili not actual English.<br />
A human who 'just says things' in a work environment isn't very useful.   Neither is software that does that.   I don't know if operating chatbots have some broader context data ~ the way humans do ~ but to replace a human staff, chatbots do need this.   There would need to be logic to add information from the knowledge base, but negatively annotate topics that contradict a filter.   For actual business process, as a human, I can talk with the US website version of a business, but I am not a US person.   I need to pay local taxes on purchases and prefer goods transacted to comply with various local safety or copyright laws.   The US company doesn't [most of the time] need to comply with my local laws, but to its local laws.   If the US goes more authoritarian on religion, and declares that no sales may occur on Sunday, the chatbot would need to know this.   But that law doesn't affect <em>me</em>.   As far as I am aware, the basic structures popularised by OpenAI do not do this type of computation.  <br />
It is useful for successful commercial delivery that stakeholders are clear about goals.   I think (but a marketing team may override me) that a predictable and reliable support agent is a good thing, and expected comms are goal driven in either direction.   There are large numbers of professions that I wouldn't have a random conversation with during their working time.   If the human is swapped for an agent, I'm still not chatting.   But a different AI agent, for example, an “anti-loneliness agent” (with no access to contracts or money) would be better with a higher unpredictability / creativity score.   <br />
From discussion on the internet, I see that LLM products are generally less useful when possible users prefer to use a language that isn't American (ISO code en-US).   Iceland being a clear example, there are less than half a million <em>íslenskur</em> speakers ~ not all of whom are exporting their culture to the internet ~ and so no LLM knows <em>íslenskur</em> (ISO code ISL).   This is particularly jarring against the adverts touting voice as an input and output mechanism.<br />
In the UK to-date, the use of AI isn't mentioned by legislation, but this may change soon <sup><a href="https://www.shoosmiths.com/insights/articles/catch-me-if-you-can-the-impact-of-chatgpt-and-how-uk-ai-regulation-might-deal-with-generative-ai" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/oblb/blog-post/2023/03/regulating-chatgpt-and-other-large-generative-ai-models" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  This Science opinion paper <sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233" target="_blank">5</a></sup> states there is no tailoring of output ~ and the paper includes an AI summary feature in the online text.<br />
Deterministic systems are much easier to test, so maximising deterministic steps on your AI should increase quality without extra dev cost.  In the extreme this will reduce the “AI” of an AI product.</p>

<p>Random text by humans is prone to bias, but if not used as your official company voice, this isn't your problem.   If your chatbot repeats this text, then it is your problem.   Vetting the inputs for making the LLM would help.  However, assuming the LLM is purchased, you won't have control to achieve that.   Similar to the sexism test in cartoons <sup><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Hawkeye_Initiative" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-hawkeye-initiative" target="_blank">2</a></sup> ~ where one character is swapped, but not their poses or actions ~ a prompt with no identity classifiers can be stereotyped to a narrower group of people easily (by adding a few neutral tone adjectives), and if this has a large tone impact to the output of your LLM, you have a biased LLM.   Repeat for each group of people, as the LLM may not be biased against everyone.  To automate this palette of tests, compare the entirely generic first prompt output to the later prompts.   Any words that are added need to be reviewed for balance ~ noting that LLM are not deterministic.   This needs to be automated to keep the value of the LLM, my current best guess solution is Lexical libraries <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicology" target="_blank">3</a></sup> in Perl (with the tests written in Perl).  A solution sketch is to feed the word delta into Wordnet <sup><a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, and grab the most vague / high-level term from the Wordnet results, and compare the deltas on each sample. <br />
As a test of whether the LLM can emit useful and relevant data, some people have carefully made test fixture populations.   These shouldn't be topical, or very advanced information.   The best one of these I have found so far is <sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SillyTavernAI/comments/1e1zte9/a_very_quick_and_easy_way_to_evaluate_your_llm/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.<br />
Other people also wanted tested, therefore reliable LLM, for example <sup><a href="https://www.rungalileo.io/blog/metrics-first-approach-to-llm-evaluation" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://pkum37.medium.com/testing-of-llm-models-a-challenging-frontier-c255e09aab06" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/05/how-to-evaluate-a-large-language-model-llm/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/how-to-test-llms-in-production/#How-to-test-LLMs-in-production" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.   These companies have setup frameworks for things that need testing.   A second test framework <sup><a href="https://www.codesmith.io/blog/an-introduction-to-llm-evaluation-how-to-measure-the-quality-of-llms-prompts-and-outputs" target="_blank">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://docs.rungalileo.io/galileo/llm-studio/prompt-inspector/choosing-your-guardrail-metrics" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, I think aimed at manual tests, sometimes including a LLM to be a test output handler.   This startup <sup><a href="https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation" target="_blank">12</a></sup> which proposes a hallucination test by repeated queries, as hallucinations do not repeat.   They also have several other tools to look at LLM.   I think using a unknown quality tool to show the quality of another unknown tool is a risky business, and in none of the supplied examples, the second AI eliminated the need for a human operator.   I strongly suspect that the double LLM test process will have a bi-modal distribution, where it works perfectly or terribly.   It has been demonstrated that most LLM have inline control signals.   A useful LLM cannot be popped to a lower level of context (same idea as an admin shell on a server), especially not by accident <sup><a href="https://ten10.com/blog/how-to-test-llm-based-chatbots/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For software that takes user input and displays it to other users (e.g. social media), normally there are clearly defined rules for no hate speech, not promoting violence, only appropriate mentions to religion, no threats, no swearing etc.  I have built Regexs to enforce these rules, and I'm sure many other developers have too.   If the internet is your data source, this is a bigger scope problem.  Example, I'm sure there is at least one youth organisation that has “YT” as an abbreviation, for “young...&quot; or “youth...&quot;, fairly innocent, and part of the legitimate function of the organisation. ...Also YouTube...  However, some pale people object to that abbreviation being used as a label for “white people”.   These are normally the people labelling and stereotyping everyone else.   My most reliable and systematic solution is not to use the unmoderated internet as a data source.</p>

<p>There are quite a few laws in the US for who you employ or not employ.  Any AI process near employment decisions needs to be carefully vetted, and its noted the hiring company has to take responsibility rather than blame a “HR contractor” human or otherwise.  I refer to the John Snow labs remote conference video content, but don't know how to reference this.  The same series of videos has a nice talk on managing the implicit bias of LLM ~ this link is an entire book on one bias that is common <sup><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/invisible-women-data-bias-in-a-world-designed-for-men-caroline-criado-perez/15136602?ean=9781419735219" target="_blank">14</a></sup>, as it is impossible to make a LLM that is less biased than its [human] sources with current technology.</p>
