In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they dont need to worry about memory management.",

It depends on your programming language and many developers have little idea how it is done.\nGarbage collection always releases memory that is no longer in use.

For example, JavaScript does this in some interesting ways, depending on whether you&rsquo;re on a browser or a Node.",
