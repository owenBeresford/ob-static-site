<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> Intro <a href="#toc0"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>Its now 2020, and I quickly made another jquery plugin.  <em>“what, why?  Do I even internet?&quot;</em><br />
I started this project in 2009, when jQuery was a reasonable abstraction layer; I didn't have much JS experience at the time, although I had been a professional developer for over five years.  Professionally I used jQuery between 2011 and 2013, maybe 2014.  In terms of deliver “reliable business solutions” for forms, or simple and mostly static websites, jQuery isn't bad.  I don't have much interest in replacing every JS tool on here with a newer more fashionable one.<br />
Since 2014 most people are migrating away from a toolkit designed to suppress browser in-compatibilities.   If I was starting this set of webpages that feel like journal articles now;  I would look at AlpineJS <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/" target="_blank">git</a>.  Note Alpine would require adding features such as a AJAJ/AJAX module separately. <br />
The reason for this intro is “what type of JS support is useful for sites that behave like journal articles”.  To a lesser extent this question also applies to blogs.  In my opinion, there isn't much interaction or scripting needed.  This implies that adding Angular, or React, or Vue (which I used sequentially in my last three employment projects, with more complex objectives) are massively over engineered tools to be able to present text.   Please note my site has a readable font (has done since about 2012) as this assists the use-case of reading text.  For comparison, none of the paid projects in the same timespan, which are using bigger Javascript tools; had non-default fonts.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> Objectives <a href="#toc1"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">To make 'similar content' articles more conspicuous from <em>an</em> article;</li>
    <li class="libasic">To make it easier to browse this site as a unit;</li>
    <li class="libasic">To be very clear/ easy to understand and use;</li>
    <li class="libasic">To reduce this sites the dependency on index pages (which as an interaction, feels strongly 1990s/ “web v1”);</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> Discussion <a href="#toc2"> <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" ></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>It is reasonable to ask “why is this implemented in JS, rather than your serverside language?&quot;.  The answer is that I would like my current article format<a class="" href="">?</a> to work with static sites.  It is not practical to statically build “the next X articles on the same topic” as a pre-computed list on each article.   Or if I do do that; to be able to update it with new content.   Secondly, if you look at quite a few blog sites; they also use a separate “related content” API; partially for syndication.  If this has been published as a design pattern, I don't know what it is called.  <i>UPDATE:</i> having written that text and feature; it now occurs to me I can keep the separate file (my requirement), and use some sort of SSI technology (on this site, probably a iceline v2 file include) to do the merging.  This may be a tad faster to render; its probably not valuable to optimise that point.   I have wasted about 10min using a “normal process” ~ AJAJ ~ to get the data to the client.  The process I did build is more re-useable.</p>

<p>As far as I observe, tag clouds are now <em>passé</em> (and have been for some time).  The related content, for example on <em>ars technica</em> e.g. <sup><a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/08/bridgefy-the-app-promoted-for-mass-protests-is-a-privacy-disaster/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> seems to solve the same objective.  It is intentional to allow an article to appear in more than one group.  Likewise its not actually required that all articles in a group are owned by me.<br />
I am not sure whether it is worth adding a new git project for this; I suppose the least wasted effort solution is to add it to the jquery-ob project.  Obviously the new feature is very tightly integrated into the CMS.</p>

<p><b>WARNING</b>: Making this feature meant I have reviewed nearly all of my content; I have improved English; I have added metadata, descriptions mostly; I have added contentGroup attribs.  This means the last edit date is now fairly pointless.  I have looked into the “file create date”; on my desktop, this is meaningless; as I have changed machine 3-4 times since 2009 when I started this website. I have looked at the “git creation date”; unfortunately I have changed software version control more than once too.  I could try to get the data out of google; but that would be a noticeable RnD project for me.  As such old articles are now listing march 2015 as the creation date, even though that under ages them by some distance.</p>

<p>As most search engine bots support JS <sup><a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/javascript-seo/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/82783/does-bing-execute-javascript-when-crawling-and-indexing-web-pages-like-google" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, there is little value in a static article index page.  If a historical tech approach is needed, I have a dynamic RSS list and a dynamic “site map” resource; which are both flat indexes; to be inclusive for older technology.  My home page is an index 'wearing a fancy hat'; I guess it needs to stay, to support users who actually type the URL in.  If you land on the site after a search; you are unlikely to see the home page at all.</p>

<p>I intend to iterate the UI; to minimise space, and supply a lot of information efficiently.  It is minor-ly worth noting that the extra tool-tip (operated with CSS) to tell you about the links is fiddly; and will need careful testing.  I have iterated the English; clearly this is a group/directory structure, but I don't think 'group' needs to be an important term in the display text.<br />
I see there are two groups of users who need the feature:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Random people who wandered in from a SERPs; but use keywords differently to me (as different location/culture/language). I think this group of people are likely to just hit “back”, as that is what I would do.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">People who have already been to the site; but went from a bookmark or similar, and are on the wrong page.  The adjacent articles feature may help these people.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have added an extra option to the fixed page menu to assist people who think its worth a few clicks to find their objective.</p>

<p>Testing on this feature is not very traditional. The meta data has a large impact on the usefulness and the readability of the feature.  The code committed to git has unit tests; but I am manually testing every single step; and adjusting the articles.  I observe a similar process in other meta data projects; which makes them expensive.</p>


<h5 id="toc3"> Technically this new Javascript tool is:</h5>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">time spent thinking about how to group the articles</li>
    <li class="libasic">a lot of time improving meta data in each article, as I am now using it more</li>
    <li class="libasic">UPDATE: today I added even more time here</li>
    <li class="libasic">a procedure that each group has a meta JSON resource to list the articles in the group </li>
    <li class="libasic">an extension to my biblio extraction tool; to build meta data indexes for the articles in the group</li>
    <li class="libasic">a [not released] script to help me aggregate the articles</li>
    <li class="libasic">a jquery plugin</li>
    <li class="libasic">a small revision to the 'reach' page template to include the extra HTML/JS</li>
    <li class="libasic">a small revision to my asset build script to include the new JS file</li>
    <li class="libasic">currently the CSS is in my main site CSS file; I ought to extract this for the separate project.</li>
    <li class="libasic">I noted previously that as I was editing my content; the <i>last edit date</i> isn't as useful as it should be (now I have touched nearly every article making this feature).  I have built a way to extract the <i>article create date</i> from <i>git</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest time spends where updating old content (<i>quelle surprise</i>) and making a solution to tooltips popping up and hiding the buttons they are for.</p>
