<p>If you want to write unit tests on JS classes, sensibly, you need a test framework.  Unit testing quite a lot of client-side JS code is hard, as it is quite involved with the DOM or webrowser.   I present a range of options. Please remember <i> 'does it feel intuitive' </i> isn't something that can be put in a unit test.  I am not presenting my own code here, as the current range of tools seem adequate (I have made a few tools previously, but those projects are firmly one of several companies IP.  The publicly available tools should be better looked after and have more investment, so represent a better solution.). <br />
<b>I repeat to be clear, this article is about unit testing JS modules and Components, not behaviour testing webpages.</b>  The I am paid for is generally complex enough that one needs to test each one, to reduce later stage costs.  Please see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-behaviour-tests#">BDD and behaviour testing</a>.<br />
I read a thread about various libraries leaving globals lying around.  Which is bad if you keep the interpreter running; but in practice, unless you are debugging your unit-test, this doesn't make any difference.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Metrics I am using for comparing test frameworks: <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>what you can test with X;</li>
    <li>complexity / time to make stable tests;</li>
    <li>ability to integrate with a common CI tool;</li>
    <li>ability to output TAP <sup><a href="https://testanything.org/producers.html#javascript" target="_blank">1</a></sup> (for linking into other tools).  There is a TAP package in npm <sup><a href="https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://github.com/ljharb/tape" target="_blank">3</a></sup>;</li>
    <li>fragility of tests;</li>
    <li>if tests are inside the browser, or outside</li>
</ul>

<p>Writing easy-to-test JS is more complex than other languages.  Nicely written Objects ~ JS style ~ do not export many symbols.  Most in-browser code is written a pluginable libraries; and each library must allow that there are other random libraries in use at the same time.  All the in-browser code shares a single namespace <i>per page</i>.  It is possible to achieve fake Namespaces, by creating your object as a <i>child object</i> e.g. <i>com.myCorporation.UsefulLibrary</i> won't clash with <i>UsefulLibrary</i> or <i>com.MonopolyCorpPLC.UsefulLibrary</i>. Pls see <sup><a href="https://elegantcode.com/2011/01/26/basic-javascript-part-8-namespaces/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> or others for more detail. Technically this isn't a namespace (compared to other languages).  Another approach is to use SEAF / IIFE ~ there are many abbreviations to this effect ~ more detail at <sup><a href="https://markdalgleish.com/2011/03/self-executing-anonymous-functions/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.mgechev.com/2012/08/29/self-invoking-functions-in-javascript-or-immediately-invoked-function-expression/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> or <sup><a href="https://www.jeffryhouser.com/index.cfm/2015/10/13/Why-use-a-self-executing-function-with-AngularJS" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.  When jQuery is being used <sup><a href="https://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, this second approach is really common.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > JS test tools <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>UPDATE 2023: I assume everyone has also done this step a few years ago; but for normal unit testing in JS, when I am using my normal edition (ES2020), I am deprecating Mocha and Jasmine.  I loose too much time trying to fight old module formats and the JS modules that the local production code is written with.   As MSIE is deprecated by MSFT, I can use class keyword if I wish.   Jest allows my to create tests at a lower level of drama.  <del>I have good use of storybook for component testing, again as modules; for the same reasons. </del>See <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/storybook#">storybook</a> for recent updates on it.</p>

<p>Writing easy-to-test JS is more complex than other languages, and reliable unit-tests are therefore harder.  Closures and Async code mean its harder to see outcomes of a method call.  As some people do crypto in JS, unit testing is essential.  For <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-behaviour-tests#">BDD and behaviour testing</a> please read the more relevant article. According to <sup><a href="https://nodesource.com/blog/seven-convenient-ci-cd-tools-for-your-node-js-projects/" target="_blank">9</a></sup> the best CI projects for JS modules are Travis and Jenkins.  Most unit test tools can run an entire suit of tests from one config file, and so can be triggered like this.  As a different idea, there are commit hooks to your version control.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/storybook#">Storybook</a></b>, I wrote a separate article on this.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>Good JS module support; includes webpack “for free”; is a <em>visual tester</em>, but can be used for BDD and unit testing components; can be used to test CSS and CSS interactions; It has many plugins.</dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>It is its own little world; puts random files all over your repo; quite alot of review is still *manual*. Not aware of many module for TAP.  <i>The recent version doesn't work for me, I will update this.</i></dd>
</dl>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/vitest#">Vitest</a></b> this tool is part of vite suite, <a href="https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest" target="_blank">npm</a> <a href="https://vitest.dev/guide/" target="_blank">docs</a>, has proper Typescript support, claims to be able to do component testing; this runs on Node18.  The GUI mode runs in watch by default; works well with Jetbrains autosave.  After a few days usage, single component tests can be made in 30min (best performed with a state-map doc about activities).   </li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>This has quite good docs; integrates with many same-generation-tools; TAP support has been built, but its not clear if released <sup><a href="https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/437" target="_blank">10</a></sup>; can be run inside a browser or outside of it <sup><a href="https://vitest.dev/guide/browser.html" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.  The GUI option is easy to operate, if you favour dashboards etc, and it includes a visual dependency graph.  Can easily compile singular react components into a TSX based unit test.   Tests are smart about JSX and TS, due to vite.</dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>I haven't found a <i>expectedException</i> feature.   It doesn't report illegal imports (i.e. imports that haven't been exported, or have been misspelled).   It took me a while to get the test files to match vs tests to match inputs correct.   <del>This wasn't mentioned when I needed it last year.</del> .  NOTICE: Creating user events in a single component test sometimes shows you nothing meaningful, if the activity is external to that component.</dd>

</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>Github page claims tests are isolated in a “browser context”, which can auto-magically share login session.  Auto-extend timing, this is built with browser code <sup><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-microsoft-playwright-its-features-brief-part-suraweera/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, so can create browser furniture and artefacts.  The Selenium crowd will be happy for the no-code action recorder <sup><a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen" target="_blank">2</a></sup>. Docs say does run from linux.</dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>There are many issues open in the github.  But unknown beyond that.</dd>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Facebook use <b>Jest</b> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/" target="_blank">git</a> as a test tool (install via npm/ yarn).  It can be used for BDD or TDD.  UPDATE 2021, I have now used Jest, Jest can be run as a CLI tool or in the browser.   If you have written complex Jest test, it supports a debugger on the test <sup><a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/troubleshooting#tests-are-failing-and-you-dont-know-why" target="_blank">3</a></sup>; however this is a bad <i>code smell</i>.    </li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>It can be setup to imitate Mocha/ Jasmine for zero-cost rollout <sup><a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/migration-guide" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  It has a bigger range of primitives than Mocha.  As it is <i>du jour</i>, it has many plugins/ CI integration extensions (see npm).  It has better integration with Typescript than Mocha.  This package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-runner-tap" target="_blank">jest-runner-tap</a> gives you TAP output, but not on the jest tests.   It can test function results, or side effects (i.e. DOM state).  Compared to older tools, it valuably supports modules.</dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>It takes me longer to setup and get it to not crash; other peoples thoughts <sup><a href="https://medium.com/@joenjenga/its-jest-common-problem-faced-using-jest-9905e96db8a" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  Not specific to this tool, but Promises need to be managed for tests to pass <sup><a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/troubleshooting#unresolved-promises" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  UPDATE: when starting with less legacy imports, you get a better experience.</dd>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Jasmine</b> is a unit-tester, similar to any other xUnit tool. It is available from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-core" target="_blank">npm</a>, <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">git</a> with <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.0/global" target="_blank">docs</a>.  It runs in-browser, or a <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/gulp-jasmine-browser" target="_blank">pretend browser</a> such as gulp; and has bindings for Node, Python and Ruby projects. </li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>nice shiny xUnit interface.  Can be run in a <a href="https://edspencer.net/2013/07/28/jasmine-and-jenkins-continuous-integration/" target="_blank">CI platform</a> <sup><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/WapAdmin/drupalcon-2013" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7609223/how-can-we-run-javascript-jasmine-tests-from-jenkins-hudson-without-loading-a" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://miparnisariblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/how-to-integrate-javascript-test-results-with-jenkins/" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.  It is designed to be easy to read <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_%28JavaScript_testing_framework%29" target="_blank">10</a></sup> , and borrows ideas from rspec, and related tools. As part of BDD rather than TDD, it defines the setup()/teardown() pair as beforeEach() and afterEach(); but ignoring the words this has the same effect.  Jasmine can be extended to support TAP with <sup><a href="https://github.com/kozy4324/Jasmine-TAPReporter" target="_blank">11</a></sup></dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>I think the Jasmine scripts are quite long, apparently so do other developers as there are several script generators eg. <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jasmine-test" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.  Early versions of Jasmine has poor support for async events (which are really common in JS). However this is fixed by now <sup><a href="https://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/javascript/using-the-done-method-in-your-jasmine-driven-asynchronous-javascript-tests.html" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Qunit</b> ~ <sup><a href="https://api.qunitjs.com/" target="_blank">14</a></sup> ~ A small and light unit tester, for JS only (i.e. it can't test CSS or HTML).  <del>I use this for</del><ins>I was previously using this for</ins>my published jquery modules. </li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>Simple and concise API. As it is just 2 files, it is light in the project repo.  If you are demoing that a JS unit is correct, without concern for a large test suite, it is very nimble.  Good for tests that need to be run a part of the DOM (i.e. you want to see that a particular DOM element is set to a value). Can be combined with <a href="https://github.com/jquery/testswarm" target="_blank">swarm project</a> to run on all webrowsers at once.  Can be made to output TAP, via <a href="https://github.com/twada/qunit-tap" target="_blank">qunit-tap</a>.   Can test function results, or side effects (i.e. DOM state).</dd>
    <dt>Liabilities</dt>
        <dd>This needs to be run in a webrowser. It will output DOM manipulations, as test results.  As such it is less use for integration with a CI/CD tool, like Jenkins. No test ability to test CSS or HTML.  Doesn't support modern code loading process (modules, or ES2020 or higher)</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Mocha/phantomjs stack</b>, has a full headless-browser browser implemented in JS <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs" target="_blank">git</a>. Mocha is another BDD spec tool <sup><a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>, written in JS.   Mocha is pretty much the same as every other spec tool, see <sup><a href="https://www.redotheweb.com/2013/01/15/functional-testing-for-nodejs-using-mocha-and-zombie-js.html" target="_blank">16</a></sup>, as example.  There is phantomjs <a href="https://phantomjs.org/documentation/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.  As a webrowser, phantomjs isn't a test tool; there are extensions <a href="https://github.com/metafeather/phantomjs-yuitest" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://github.com/jamesgpearce/confess" target="_blank">git</a> <sup><a href="https://yslow.org/ruleset-matrix/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> .  Phantomjs does have evaluate(), which is functionally eval().   Twitter use Phantomjs with Qunit <sup><a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/what-is-phantomjs-and-how-is-it-used" target="_blank">18</a></sup> as a another decision making API.  </li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt>Strengths</dt>
        <dd>Mocha supports TAP <sup><a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/automation-testing-advisor/javascript/mocha-TAP" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.  Phantomjs has close match to Chrome, Safari and a few minor browsers, as it links webkit.  As a node project, Mocha links to common CI tools eg <sup><a href="https://medium.com/@mosheezderman/how-to-set-up-ci-cd-pipeline-for-a-node-js-app-with-jenkins-c51581cc783c" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.  For a pure JS unit (no DOM, not much DI), it would be faster to omit phantom i.e. <sup><a href="https://coderwall.com/p/qaebwq/running-mocha-tests-without-a-browser-not-even-phantomjs" target="_blank">21</a></sup></dd>
    <dt>Weakness</dt>
        <dd>Unfortunately, this is old webkit, in the fake-browser. The phantomJS project has been closed says <sup><a href="https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2018/03/27/phantomjs-is-dead-use-chrome-headless-in-continuous-integration.html" target="_blank">22</a></sup></dd>
