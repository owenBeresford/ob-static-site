<p>This is one of those sections which is too wordy to fit on my CV.</p>

<p>I think skills and experience are difficult to organise and needs factoring into several categories.  From the perspective of skills for employability, everything [especially in technology] is time bracketed.  I omit everything I have done with mobiles from my CV, as it is two generations ago, and irrelevant. The visual ratios I learned as a small boy doing graphical stuff will never change.  Conversely the preferred method for doing AJAX changes quite often.  Can I do page design? yes.  Should I apply for print industry jobs? probably not.</p>

<p>This document will be the long version of my section in my CV.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Meta skills <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>I have a persistent conflict on what people actually want from “experience”.   Strategy level decisions are what will kill a project most easily.  To describe one trend: to follow the herd leads you to have a good tool chain, wide understanding on your goals, and objectives.  The other trend is to be different, this lets one have abnormal advantages.  That is, a new process may give one much bigger margins or reduced risks.  For some time at an employer, despite pure Linux live environment, I was anomalous for favouring Linux rather than an ms product for my desktop.  I felt that Linux had many more tools that needed to do my job.</p>

<p>I am an experienced OO developer. My skills on this are OOA and OOD, not concentrating on any tool chain.   I have been using OO PHP is some guise for nearly every working day for more than ten years.  When I need to use strpos() I look up the order of the params (in my IDE).   If this was a brand new language and library suite I had never used before, I may not know specifically what the function was called, but I would know where to look (string manipulation).  What therefore, does experience mean?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2013:</strong>  In my current situation, I am changing languages and platforms with higher frequency.  I now <strong>have</strong> to reference manuals regularly, as I have changed API four times in the five last days for accessing DB (DBI, Moracle, Ora_perl, PDO).  Likewise I am concurrently editing content for three different wiki processors (including the text you are currently reading); and use six regex libraries (JS, vim, Perl, a wiki library, grep, mysql regex).  As I know how to use each library, this doesn't slow me down noticeably; but I am dependant on documentation, and a network connection to access it.</p>

<p>Having written all of the above, a decent Perl programmer I am working with, recently patched a PHP application.  He opened a vast security hole, as he didn't know what he was doing in that foreign language, and choose a really simple solution.  When I write that I understand a particular libraries methods and concepts; I am claiming I don't do things like that, as I understand it already.</p>

<p>What would I consider my meta-skills?</p>

<ol>
    <li>Software design;</li>
    <li>Factoring &amp; chunking.  Putting structures in useful size blobs;</li>
    <li>Expectations of communication, one of the things I take from Agile and new media, is regular information flows;</li>
    <li>Consistency - that is my APIs and similar have a coherent structure, so one may learn them quickly;</li>
    <li>Simplicity of abstractions.  To solve a complex problem in a clear and understandable method is sign of deep understanding and value of aesthetics; </li>
    <li>Graphical layout/ 2D &amp; 3D topology.  I don't understand the separation of this from my second point;</li>
</ol>

<p>I deny being limited to what I have done before.  Neither is anyone else.<br />
As a back of envelope calculation, you need to solve problemX, I can:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Implement featureX using methodX (cost X, risk X, results X, known process);</li>
    <li>Implement featureX using methodY (cost to plan X, cost to implement X, risk 3X, therefore 2X or 3X testing, outcome upto 2.5X);</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is better?</p>
