<p>I built this list of tools/ libraries/ packages as in 2017 I needed to edit a SVG at runtime in the user's browser; and I thought there had to be a better solution than <em>document.getElementById</em>.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > 9 local-install SVG editor libraries which seem maintained  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>Software without unit-tests or enough documentation is likely to consume a lot of your time, hence I avoid them.  This first list is useful if you want to make a platform that includes editing SVG images (probably a graph/ chart).   The goal of this list compiled in 2017 was to be able to fix SVG assets that minority browsers wheren't rendering correctly.  As 90% of the browser population was correct I didn't want to swap to a JPEG or something.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic"><i>svg-edit</i> <a href="https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit" target="_blank">git</a> available with MIT or apache licences.  It runs purely in a recent browser, and is an alternative to Inkscape if you can't use that.  The first team completed the project and froze it, in about 2017, at v3.   A second team has taken over the project, emphasising support for today's browsers at v7.3; the second team published via NPM as <i>svgedit</i> and in Netify.   Version 7 uses HTML5 canvases.    </li>
    <li class="libasic">This should be linkable: If your objective is diagrams  not logos, look at <b>GoJs</b> <a href="https://gojs.net/latest/index.html" target="_blank">docs</a> which shows as many options as google libraries; <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS" target="_blank">git</a>.   As a diagram editor, it also has data-binding and inline data models.  It has a support QnA sub-site <sup><a href="https://forum.nwoods.com/c/gojs/11" target="_blank">1</a></sup> and mentions “undo” as a feature on the main docs page.  Install from NPM as <b>gojs</b>; they claim it integrates with common component frameworks like React.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">Alternatively for working-document diagrams, <i>mermaidjs</i> is really nice <sup><a href="https://mermaid.js.org/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/intro/n00b-syntaxReference.html" target="_blank">docs</a> and <a href="https://mermaid.live/" target="_blank">live demo</a>.  Install via NPM <i>mermaid</i> or use <a href="https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid" target="_blank">git</a> has a first MIT licence and it seems to have Cypress tests.  It is driven by flat ASCII like markdown, and as it renders in your browser it will have a very fast iteration rate.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Visualiser <i>Raphaël</i> ~ pls note UTF8 name ~ <a href="https://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/reference.html" target="_blank">docs</a> and is MIT license.  This is an old JS project <sup><a href="https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, it is compared to <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588718/jquery-svg-vs-raphael" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  It has an O'Reilly <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/raphaeljs/9781449365356/" target="_blank">book</a>.  It supports a version of data binding (remember this predates Angular by several years).</li>
    <li class="libasic">Able to transform an SVG on a readonly page: <i>SVG.js</i> <sup><a href="https://svgjs.dev/docs/3.0/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, in NPM as <i>@svgdotjs/svg.js</i> <a href="https://github.com/svgdotjs/" target="_blank">git</a> MIT license.  I have never used this.  This is designed to be small, and not have dependencies, quoting the first link, which includes a lot of docs.  The project has an eponymous twitter channel.  Can be used to edit existing SVG, although it would be clumsy to do this on each page render.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">Generator <i>svg-draw</i> is a declarative SVG creator, you type statements in JS and it renders it for you.  It's in NPM as <i>svg-draw</i> <a href="https://github.com/VladislavPetyukevich/svg-draw" target="_blank">git</a> the minimal docs are <sup><a href="https://github.com/VladislavPetyukevich/svg-draw" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, but it has tests.  It has no deps, and is under GPL licence. </li>
    <li class="libasic"><i>jquery.svg</i> <sup><a href="http://keith-wood.name/svgRef.html" target="_blank">7</a></sup> <a href="https://github.com/kbwood/svg" target="_blank">git</a>, MIT license, to clarify, code by Keith Wood (This project has many forks).  This version hasn't been touched in three years.  Code does not have unit tests, and there are un-merged branches, which add more recent technologies.  Recommend using a fork that has maintenance. </li>
    <li class="libasic">Able to transform SVG on a readonly page: <i>jquery-svg</i> <a href="https://github.com/mberneti/jquery-svg" target="_blank">git</a> MIT license, a plugin to “A lightweight jQuery plugin to apply css styles and js scripts to a SVG which is embedded (using the &lt;object&gt; tag” (quoting the last link).  Read the code, its a simple class.  Obviously this class can be merged with other classes to achieve more complex behaviour; this doesn't directly have document editing (reference: oab1 test code).</li>
    <li class="libasic">Generator <i>Inkscape</i> (previously named Sodipodi) <sup><a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape" target="_blank">9</a></sup> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sodipodi/" target="_blank">sodipodi project</a>, inkscape project is run on BZR, and I can't find the repo. This is a desktop application, mostly written for Linux, although it runs on other OS. It is OSS (GPL), and may be deployed without a charge. I put this item here, as this is the best solution for quick edits to existing files.  As a Linux user, install via apt, dnf etc. Tools for other OS may vary e.g. MacOSX <sup><a href="https://inkscape.org/release/0.92.2/mac-os-x/" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   I do not know how to link or script this option. </li>
    <li class="libasic">As a negative mention <i>snapsvg</i> <sup><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/snapsvg" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://snapsvg.io/" target="_blank">12</a></sup>, under Apache2 license.   It seems to be owned by Adobe Inc (see github account) <a href="https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg/" target="_blank">git</a>, and they demand paper address of any contributors.  As an older project, there are many open tickets.  UPDATE 2023: it still has pull requests and open tickets on NPM; don't use this library as it's not maintained. </li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > 6 Online SVG editors (maybe pay-for service) <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>If you do not have a desktop install for image generation; but need to manipulate an image, then these are quite useful.   This list is focussing on SVG format again.   In theory you could run these on your phone; but I suspect you would get better experience with a bigger screen.   I checked a few details for each editor, if you are a full-time designer/ illustrator/ animator you are likely to have a long detailed list of features that you need.   <i>NB: There are many many articles listing SVG editors online</i>, I added this extra section as it showed as a frequent Google search term.  As other notes say you can only scale SVG to a few thousand polygons, drawing via a webrowser doesn't make this limit lower; sentence being biased as 3d rendering engines use many more polygons, <em>but they are all triangles</em>.</p>
