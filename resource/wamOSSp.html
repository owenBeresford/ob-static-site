<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > What opensource <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>When talking with a non-colleague about one of their client's current system, I noticed what I say I do (in terms of architecture and process); and what my open source list show contradict each other.  That I can install wordpress, and write an article on how to install wordpress is not worth doing.   This is a list of where I invested my spare time:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>my OLDEST web-renderer; <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A long time ago I needed PHP5 experience; but my then CTO didn't want the risk of upgrading operational platforms.</li>
        <li>First version was about 10 days' work between contracts.   My biggest test population in a single project in 2010. </li>
        <li>Started in 2009; platform version 2 was 2013; the source in github is build 3 from 2016, and much better managed; build 4 was skin only, and 2018; build 5 is JAMstack and newer phone support.   Build 6 improves accessibility and improves loading time, this is what you see now.</li>
        <li>For features pls look at the OLD web-renderer (in github as icelinerenderer)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>my static site project <strong>ob-static-site</strong>;<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>where all the content and front-end work is. </li>
        <li>Probably this counts as version 7 skin by now.  Current edition is HTML5, accessible, fairly adaptive.   The next project makes it more light weight.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>replacement JS (<strong>extra-panda</strong>);<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I replaced a large volume of old code that was hard to maintain and update with a new small fast and well tested code. </li>
        <li>modular API is much easier to manage.  New code has 4% volume of old code.</li>
        <li>Good test coverage, TS, Vitest, 2024 work across 2 months. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>cat profile demo</strong>;<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A simple demo to deliver a solution for React component testing that had low overheads.</li>
        <li>Has been used as a tool setup repo (JSDoc, Vitest, Storybook)</li>
        <li>CODE has expired, but was built during 2022 I think</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>punit</strong>; <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted my phpunit skelgen tooling in Perl.</li>
        <li>? 2015 ? </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>phpunit-skelgen</strong> ;<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I did maintenance on a older project that the owner had shelved; I made it PHP7 and made the result unit-tests easer to use.</li>
        <li>? 2016 ?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>sums + mocha demo</strong> in JS;<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted to have a reference demo for setting up Mocha. </li>
        <li>The Mocha bit was done in a few evenings.   It took ages to get my trees to balance properly, so operator precedence worked correctly.   I think 2018</li>
        <li>I deprecate Mocha usage, by the time this was complete.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A minimal customer-managed CMS (was accessible historically as the TBBS website);  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I needed experience in Agile development, and YAGNI approach.</li>
        <li>DEPRECATED 2011 delivered in 2 months, end to end; work (and meetings) only at weekends.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>presentation asserts;<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A JS library to inject into unit test frameworks, to improve ability to make declarative statements about the current DOM.  Returns CSS units in normalised form, so unit tests are more reliable.  It reduces code length in the unit-tests.</li>
        <li>Code is in the conf project in my git account, also links a Color library for normalising color formats.</li>
        <li>Done in 2019 I think</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Vitest extension (not yet released);<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A short term feature to allow vitest scripts to be run inside a browser, to test HTTPS only JS features and get better CSS evaluation.   </li>
        <li>Outputs a standard unit test PASS/ FAIL note to the console, just like Vitest, Jest etc.</li>
        <li>Released version will be in TS, and includes a build step to bundle the unit-tests scripts, so the test server is simple and needs no maintenance.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>My current <strong>shopping app.</strong>  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted more Typescript experience.  </li>
        <li>Done in 2023, shelved</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Why testing <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>On my personal github repo, there are 18, UPDATE: no 12 projects (one of which is an aggregate); and source for three test frameworks in three different languages and four test templates/ libraries; on my website there are loads of articles for test technologies.  I deleted alot of old JS that was wasn't managed.  Why all this attention on testing?</p>

<p>Reasons</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>I mostly work in startups, there isn't enough daytime budget to do “nice to have” items; have to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LW7YEZ9/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">MoveFastAndBreakStuff</a> (not affiliate link);</li>
    <li>I do use tools built by someone else where possible, as its cheaper; these are the ones I can't find (or last version isn't maintained);</li>
    <li>Most people do not think test tech as being a trade secret or high value IP; so they see no conflict of interest with it slopping around between projects;</li>
    <li>Being abit dyslexic, there are times when I make ridiculous typo-style errors, tests avoid these going anywhere; </li>
    <li>Test infra/automation is mostly immune to fashion; so if I make a tool now, it will still be useful in 5Y time;</li>
    <li>I like being able to deliver a fairly high level of test coverage at a low cost.  Managing the tool-chain is required, and writing it helps a large margin (referencing the tweaks to phpunit-skelgen). </li>
    <li>Some of my test solutions are really creative, er, solutions.</li>
</ul>
