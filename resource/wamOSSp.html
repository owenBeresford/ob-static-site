<h2 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > What opensource <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>When talking with a non-colleague about one of their client's current system, I noticed what I say I do (in terms of architecture and process); and what my open source list show contradict each other.  That I can install wordpress, and write an article on how to install wordpress is not worth doing.   This is a list of where I invested my spare time:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>my OLDEST web-renderer; <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A long time ago I needed PHP5 experience; but my then CTO didn't want the risk of upgrading operational platforms.</li>
        <li>First version was about 10 days' work between contracts.   My biggest test population in a single project in 2010. </li>
        <li>Started in 2009; platform version 2 was 2013; the source in github is build 3 from 2016, and much better managed; build 4 was skin only, and 2018; build 5 is JAMstack and newer phone support.   Build 6 improves accessibility and improves loading time, this is what you see now.</li>
        <li>For features pls look at the OLD web-renderer (in githubi as icelinerenderer)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>my static site project [name]<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>where all the content and front-end work is. </li>
        <li>Probably this counts as version 7 skin by now.  Current edition is HTML5, accessible, fairly adaptive.   The next project makes it more light weight.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>replacement JS (<strong>extra-panda</strong>):<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I replaced a large volume of old code that was hard to maintain and update with a new small fast and well tested code. </li>
        <li>modular API is much easier to manage.  New code has 4% volume of old code.</li>
        <li>Good test coverage, TS, Vitest, 2024 work across 2 months. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>cat profile demo</strong><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>A simple demo to deliver a solution for React component testing that had low overheads.</li>
        <li>Has been used as a tool setup repo (JSDoc, Vitest, Storybook)</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>punit,</strong> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted my phpunit skelgen tooling in Perl.</li>
        <li>? 2015 ? </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>phpunit-skelgen,</strong> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I did maintenance on a older project that the owner had shelved; I made it PHP7 and made the result unit-tests easer to use.</li>
        <li>? 2016 ?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><strong>sums + mocha demo</strong> in JS<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted to have a reference demo for setting up Mocha. </li>
        <li>The Mocha bit was done in a few evenings.   It took ages to get my trees to balance properly, so operator precedence worked correctly.   I think 2018</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A minimal customer-managed CMS (was accessible historically as the TBBS website);  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I needed experience in Agile development, and YAGNI approach.  </li>
        <li>2011 delivered in 2 months, end to end; work (and meetings) only at weekends.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>My current <strong>shopping app.</strong>  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>I wanted more Typescript experience.  </li>
        <li>Done in 2022, shelved</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Why testing <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>On my personal github repo, there are 18, UPDATE: no 12 projects (one of which is an aggregate); and source for three test frameworks in three different languages and four test templates/ libraries; on my website there are loads of articles for test technologies.  I deleted alot of old JS that was wasn't managed.  Why all this attention on testing?</p>

<p>Reasons</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>I mostly work in startups, there isn't enough daytime budget to do “nice to have” items; have to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LW7YEZ9/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">MoveFastAndBreakStuff</a> (not affiliate link);</li>
    <li>I do use tools built by someone else where possible, as its cheaper; these are the ones I can't find (or last version isn't maintained);</li>
    <li>Most people do not think test tech as being a trade secret or high value IP; so they see no conflict of interest with it slopping around between projects;</li>
    <li>Being abit dyslexic, there are times when I make ridiculous typo-style errors, tests avoid these going anywhere; </li>
    <li>Test infra/automation is mostly immune to fashion; so if I make a tool now, it will still be useful in 5Y time;</li>
    <li>I like being able to deliver a fairly high level of test coverage at a low cost.  Managing the tool-chain is required, and writing it helps a large margin (referencing the tweaks to phpunit-skelgen). </li>
    <li>Some of my test solutions are really creative, er, solutions.</li>
</ul>
