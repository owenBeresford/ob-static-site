<p>This is a very quick article I built to show a non-tech manager.  Data that is good for display isn't the same as data that is good for user-input derived searching.   This is made-up data, I think it's unlikely that a road in Oslo would be labelled in correct french, “frenchish” but is more likely to be written in the Norwegian alphabet.</p>

<p>I think the full UTF-8 version is prettier and more accurate. <br />
<b>Firstly</b>; this is why it's a good idea to brutalise fields that get used as search indexes down to ASCII, so people can easily type a nearly correct string, <b>and get what they wanted</b>.  In terms of UI interactions, I do not know what process to follow for a pictographic language in search.  Yes, pictographic languages will not have prefix/ suffix, but how does partial match work? <br />
<b>Secondly</b>; the last index should have stop words removed, the words stemmed and all the punctuation stripped.  The stemming process doesn't make as much sense for address-data as general search queries.  Note the type has changed here, so partial matches are faster.  With the tokenised data, it is easier to search for venues in this area; looking at “that restaurant on London road”, there are <i>many</i> roads called that in the southern half of England.   Those terms should match that particular venue, but should be tagged against other cucina venues.  I would probably filter town names from the search word cache, as it's not precise enough.   I don't think users would laboriously enter a complete venue postal address into their phone app.<br />
<b>Thirdly</b>; on good systems, the place name to long /lat mapping should be bidirectional, and quick.   This is a separate feature to the above item, but probably same input interaction.  It is common to allow entry of a location as an alternative to current GPS data; this is to allow users to ask the GIS system about where they <i>will be</i> or <i>where</i>, rather than only limiting to where they are currently.<br />
<b>Fourthly</b>: For a large-scale system, it may be a good idea to duplicate the search cache according to regional pronunciation or common misspellings, as a speech to text benefit; and secondly people typing quickly may mistype.</p>

<p>Much of the UI niceties code that I write <i>looks</i> simple from the outside, but is big and complex as I am miming how humans think.  Also similar to human thought, if I have spare CPUs, making the above several different strategies operate concurrently is a nicer experience.</p>
