<p><strong>This article was more important in 2012.</strong><br />
As a person calling themselves a software engineer, I need to say I use design patterns, and sound educated in them; their use, and the anti-patterns.  I have read the books, and use what was written in them when it seems relevant to the solution.  In many places, I talk with commercial people, or clients; and so I was never talking about design patterns.  There are places, where I intuitively worked out a structure that looked like a pattern, but didn't use the same name.   I always <i>write code that I can manage</i>.  I value teamwork, which makes design patterns important.   Article is quite boring, and it would be more useful with a code repo.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > PHP design patterns <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I need to make a new article for other languages.   I note that as comprehension in small companies is important, so I focus on DDD.  I want to be able to discuss solutions as part of costs; and non-technical people will find the genericness of design patterns opaque/ vague. <br />
It is important this create a standard for pluralisation or not, and stick with it.   Before this decision is made, external systems should be reviewed to avoid large impedance when a dev is using both concurrently.</p>


<aside class="pullout" >
<p>Describing <strong>software</strong> architecture in terms of buildings, my style oscillates between a squat Brutalist carpark and an airy high Gothic cathedral in Barcelona.  With the first extreme, it is 1970s flavoured, ugly, has high running costs, and emits lots of carbon. But I assembled a solution inside a fortnight and it serves the first 1000 people reliably.  The other extreme is beautiful, has a strong aesthetic and inspires a million visits from around the globe.  It is efficient; but it took a generation, and will remain for the next 400 years.</p>


</aside>
<p><b>Edit 2022</b>: This paragraph will probably get extracted into its own article, purely for linguistics/ cultural structuring.   A few years ago I bought and read a book on JS design patterns.  I didn't think it had much material absent from structures built in older programming languages in it.   Now React is mature enough to a) have an out-of-language renderer ~ Reactnative b) start to sell senior positions on the basis of use of design patterns.   Therefore, I am now doing the same writing style as previous but use these terms.   I am using Typescript where possible, as that allows Interfaces, and extra behaviour on types.  In my opinion, a very clear benefit to using Typescript is adding Interfaces on your props, as a) humans and the compiler read them, b) everything needs to have a single version or it won't compile, c) in terms of dev-time, this is very cheap documentation.  I still factor out Services from Components, to make testing easier/ faster.  Services generally follow a linear set of steps, and React's more functional design makes deterministic state monitoring harder.  If I wasn't doing that I could make them Container Components.   When I make a Service, I export it via a useXXX() function, to match the other library features, and to be able to limit object creation/ add shared references.   This is either a Factory function, or a Singleton depending on details.  I still use Facade structures to encapsulate and apply SRP on static config on imported libraries; and I build Presentational components and Render props components (ugly name) as a means to reduce code duplication.    On the scale of work I build, I use a simplified version of State Design as a wrapped useState(); as a full blown version wouldn't add any benefit, but cost time.   In theory I should be using HOC ~ high order components ~ as the epitome of functional programming; but I haven't met a business need where that would add value.</p>

<p>Over the last year [this is 2013-2014], mostly for contracts where it has most relevance; I have been naming classes according to design pattern references; specifically as I wouldn't be on tap for later changes.  Truthfully, I am just ensuring the classnames to match what the online books say.  The structures ~ allowing reuse and stability ~ are needed for both DDD and patterns.</p>

<p>Obviously the best article would reference commercial code samples; but this is more difficult for system/ back end developers.  Companies I talk with more recently understand the need for an architect type role; my fluency will help here as well.  This text is <b>written without using the internet or paper references</b> or it wouldn't have meant very much.</p>

<p>Structures that I use in no particular order:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Inside PHP I am targeting Symfony2+ as a framework (<strong>EDIT 2020</strong> Obviously newer version after 2014 are in use), I use <b>MVC</b> and related algorithms.  Inside Perl I use Catalyst.  I have created implementations of this algorithm previously from scratch. I have used <b>MVP</b> in places where there was too much rendering logic.  This algorithm is valuable as there are many frameworks for it.  It allows large amounts of work to be automated/ done by the libraries.   In comparison to tools like Wordpress, it doesn't constrain one to simple things.</li>
    <li>At time of writing I have yet to build a proper <b>MVVM</b>, but that is a result of giving clients what they need, rather than lack of skill.  There are many companies that think it more important to hold decision making on the server (commercial common sense).</li>
    <li>For most companies, construction as a <b>SOA</b> is most sensible, I have built a couple.   After 2012, I would describe this process as building <b>SaaS<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=SaaS">?</a></b> instead.   </li>
    <li>As code in the browser gets larger, I am using <b>SPA</b>, and Component design.  I built <b>EventBus</b> / MQ in 2020 to allow better experience with a many tabbed SPA UI.  I have used SPA libraries across several, years per major SPA vendor.    </li>
    <li>I am using <b>CQRS</b> after people started talking about it, but technically, I always split my DB permissions up, as I often work with DB clusters (especially at first role).</li>
    <li>I always use ObjectComposition<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ObjectComposition">?</a> rather than inheritance; since it became practical at PHP5.  In more flexible languages like Python or Perl, I used from first use.</li>
    <li><b>EDIT Jan 2015</b>, from <sup><a href="https://phptherightway.com/pages/Design-Patterns.html" target="_blank">1</a></sup> I note that there is a formal name for the single access point is <b>Front Side Controller</b>.  I have always used this, but not considered it a pattern, as it is barely an object; just reduces errors, and reduces costs.  I also have used <b>HMVC</b> where this is  relevant to the framework (repacking for multiple output formats is nice with this).  </li>
    <li><b>Singletons</b> are an item on GoF, but break many OO traits.  They are the standard way to build logging or resources that only make sense with a single item.  I use them for Logs, and frequently config objects.</li>
    <li>I use <b>Transformers</b> and <b>Adaptors</b>.</li>
    <li>Recently, I am using <b>Containers</b>, using the term like Symfony dynamically created objects from your config files.  Please do not confuse with Docker/ VM Containers, which are the same pattern in different software.   I was using <b>Factories</b>.  I am using this less than I used, due to DI being technically feasible in PHP.  I'm not sure if I should include this, as I haven't written a <b>DI</b> yet, but I use other peoples DI libraries.  Obviously using DI requires that I am using <b>IoC</b>.  I have built some IoC structures. </li>
    <li>I make a variety of <b>Producers</b> and <b>Consumers</b>, sometimes <b>PubSub<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=PubSub">?</a></b>.</li>
    <li>I over use <b>Models</b> to isolate all the SQL to a single file for an <b>Entity</b>, or sometimes a <b>Queue</b>.   I manage and faction my Models or they climb in size.   I should manage Models via a <b>Repository</b> (rather than the simpler and faster approach of giving the Service knowledge and have them ask for the Model when loading/ DI).    </li>
    <li>I use <b>Collections/Iterators</b> when it seems to make sense.  I prefer to use arrays in some situations, for performance.   Where I use data as a scalar, I am using <b>Entities</b>.</li>
    <li>I use <b>Facade</b> classes, frequently over an array of implementations (single access point, correct behaviour depending on data supplied).</li>
    <li>With newer languages ~ say Golang ~ I use <b>Threads</b>.   My older experience <b>Workers</b> for multiprocess applications, and Managers to allocate resources.   Early versions of Linux and Unix where focussing on “simple and stable”, at the expense of Threads ~ see Multics and Vax as other computational models with Threads.   </li>
    <li>I use <b>Validation</b> libraries and Managers for them.  Do not know the Pattern for this (Adaptor?), but its a common structure.   It is used in Symfony2+3, but the ones I was referencing I wrote from scratch initially.  </li>
    <li>Output <b>Rasterisers</b> / templating libraries.</li>
    <li>Some of my work should be formalised as <b>Observer</b> and <b>Subject</b> pattern.  I copied this from graphics rendering pipelines, where it is abit altered.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>I have built quite a few OO tree structures, and some linked lists. </li>
    <li>I have built many FSM ~ in OO known as a <b>State</b> pattern.  </li>
    <li>Historically, I tend to use SAX XML parsers, rather than DOM.  The business use-cases often have alot of data, so DOM would exceed locally available RAM.</li>
    <li>Where the language allows, I use flyweight classes where I need alot of a given object.  See the previous SAX parser as an example.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>I will write more on this subject in later articles.</b>   The title on this is for PHP, however after 2018, I am using PHP less, and working with Golang, TS and Python and C++.  This might be simpler if I structured the article as 'in year XXX, I used language XXX1 and managed complexity with patterns XX1, XX2, XX3, XX4, XX5' rather than update the text.   Maybe in a tabbed / folding structure in the page.</p>
