<p>This text was previously accessible under <i>.../cloud-hosting-2017</i>.  I have updated it.  I am only mentioning hosting on Linux as one needs high availability and stability at low cost.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Context <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>For this type of analysis the important difference between a VPS and cloud is quite minor.  In other contexts, a cloud is a more vaguely defined and may have less features.   A VPS <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank">1</a></sup> is specifically a full virtual server, with no public IP.</p>

<p><b>old Q:</b> <i>Why should a business use a cloud or VPS (vs an on-prem option)?</i> <br />
<b>A:</b> <i>To amortise costs across time and to get seamless upgrades; with support at higher levels than may be locally feasible.</i></p>

<p><b>Q:</b> <i>Which is more useful, a plain VPS / VM or multiple specific services?</i><br />
<b>A:</b> <i>If you are starting from fresh, the separate services are cheaper to run; but don't map well to older software.  Rewriting a whole product is a daunting expense; with marginal gains.  Small steps can be taken, like moving the DB to the specific service for biggest cost change. </i></p>

<p>Note: some industries benefit from all the computation being done in the same national borders where the founders live and advertise.   Aside from legal and commercial concerns; having the servers physically nearer you or your customers' means there is generally a better connection speed (someone else's opinion on geo-location <sup><a href="https://geekflare.com/best-hosting-for-india-market/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> ).   The reason for this rewrite is to update and add further locales to this list.   <br />
Care about which countries data handling laws are being applied to your clients' data is important; and outside the scope of this technical article (also this will change for each starting location).   UK government notes <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/creating-and-implementing-a-cloud-hosting-strategy" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  See [book1] for discussion on this problem if your company is the size of Microsoft. <br />
I observe that Amazon is frequently NOT the cheapest retailer on the slightly obscure stock in its online shops.  I assume the same business practice of optimising for the most common sale applies to SaaS.   Many of these VPS items <sup><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vps" target="_blank">4</a></sup> are labelled “public cloud”; I guess an architect would call the VMs running inside company firewalls a “private cloud”.  The public options can be firewalled into isolation.  <br />
There are some companies that claim to sell in a given country; by which they mean they have a bank account in that place but no other facility, and resell a larger vendors products.  This is not very useful for the buyer.</p>

<p><b>I advise looking at each vendor at point of purchase</b>, as pricing will change since I wrote this.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Metrics/ Values <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I have been in teams doing global deployment multiple times.  This article makes me see the difference between global deployment and services in each country.</p>


<h5 id="toc2"> Whats important for selecting a VPS / “full VM” option: </h5>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li class="libasic">Proximity of server real hardware to the client machine.  Use of caching can increase useful distance.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Service uptime (needs to be very high percentage).  I note that GCP down prioritises VPS that aren't being used over long weekends, and traffic will be a lot delayed for 5min on the first morning after.  This isn't technically a service outage; but is annoying.  I would assume other cloud providers have the same effect.  </li>
    <li class="libasic">Business process (e.g. billing, support, documentation's locale) running in a locale that works for the client. </li>
    <li class="libasic">Cost, the product being sold is a commodity.  Billing in local currency is good for clients, as it side steps fluctuations on the ForEx.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Access to 'good' fixed IPs; which are not used by spammers or scammers.  This is a social engineering item.</li>
    <li class="libasic">Awareness of local legislation and features to support it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the local UK brands have changed from five years ago with the first version of this article.</p>

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Largest cloud providers <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>To the best of my knowledge; these are the largest ones.  They each have proper international availability, although are more sparse in Africa.</p>

<h5 id="toc8"> PRC </h5>
<p>(i.e. sat inside the “great firewall”)<br />
PRC is still a regulated economy, running services on their local systems requires ID and “a Chinese process”.  Notes say that bandwidth on the Chinese market is more expensive than elsewhere <sup><a href="https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/181455/china-vps-needed" target="_blank">24</a></sup>, maybe due to the moderators.  I have been assuming that all pricing would be written in Arabic numbers; maybe that is a bad assumption.</p>

<hr />
<p>There are other regions with smaller cloud hosting companies.</p>

<p>Other (including people who sell wordpress hosting) <sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-cloud-hosting/" target="_blank">36</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cloud-hosting-providers" target="_blank">37</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/largest-web-hosting-companies/" target="_blank">38</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/largest-web-hosting-companies/" target="_blank">39</a></sup><br />
A company <a href="https://kinsta.com/" target="_blank">Kinsta</a> who mostly sell cloud-based Wordpress hosting; have quite a good article describing Cloudflare <sup><a href="https://kinsta.com/cloudflare-market-share/" target="_blank">40</a></sup>.   It says Cloudflare is the dominant general CDN/ static host by a large margin.   The article claims that although Cloudflare grew by 50% in 2020; they still can service a good anti-!DDoS<a class="" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=DDoS">?</a> feature.</p>
