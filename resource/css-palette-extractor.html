<p>Obviously code I don't need to write is available faster.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><a href="https://alwane.io/" target="_blank">Alwane</a> is a dedicated web-scrapper that builds nice palettes, and is fast/ easy.  Doesn't mention contexts, similar to Adaption.  Has a list of palettes that ship with common frameworks <sup><a href="https://alwane.io/palettes" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.colorcombos.com/grabcolors.html" target="_blank">Colour combo</a> <del>The name reminds me of 90's beat-'em-up games.</del> Builds a nice palette on a horizontal scroll, can edit the palette from the browser.  Again not reporting about adaptive styles.</li>
    <li>If you can put the CSS on your local disk, <b>css-color-extractor-cli</b> <sup><a href="https://github.com/rsanchez/css-color-extractor-cli" target="_blank">2</a></sup> looks useful to do some work  that photoshop does.  Documents what CSS colours it knows about, offers colour format conversion.  It can build a HTML swatch palette.   Again not reporting about adaptive styles.</li>
    <li><a href="https://csspeeper.com/" target="_blank">CSS peeper</a> is a chrome extension <sup><a href="http://bit.ly/2h52BoV" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  Not used this, but due to local installation, may cover adaption stuff.</li>
    <li><a href="https://hexcolor.co/css-color-extractor" target="_blank">Hex Colour</a> this does a single CSS file only, if you have multiple CSS files (maybe per device tweaks), this is less useful.   Includes links to related tools, and tech SEO links at bottom of page.</li>
    <li>Very skimpy solution, Phrasefix <sup><a href="https://phrasefix.com/tools/extract-hex-color-codes/" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, paste CSS into it, it extracts the colours written in hex.</li>
    <li>Unmention to colorhound.net, as they understand “white-space” CSS declaration to be a colour value.</li>
    <li>Honourable mention to svay.com/blog/css-color-palette-extractor but the code isn't finished yet (links to github on page)</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Goal  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>To have a palette extractor to easily look at the whole of the colours (or other CSS attribute) used in a code repo.   In terms of buildings/ property, these are called swatches, or possibly swatch palette for many swatches together.   <br />
I think this is better applied to compiled CSS, so there is less different means to add another CSS file in, and all the SCSS, LESS, SAAS will have been compiled away.<br />
IMPORTANT: Note, this is to look at your palette, not to say what CSS is in effect in a given situation.</p>

<p>Why am I writing myself these specs? Stating it would be useful to have a tool isn't the same as knowing what it will cost to get it or build it.   Articles like this are a bit dull and talking-to-myself, <i>BUT</i> I now have worked out how hard it is.   As I am looking to see what 3rd party tools are available as part of this process, I am also working out if random things are useful to my problem.  You still think its boring? yeah, um, look at the maquettes?<br />
CSS is not a small language.   Below are lists of CSS features and selectors etc that a parser would need to understand.<br />
This article is focussing on colour for swatches, but a mature tool should allow other CSS attributes to be built into a table.<br />
<b>UPDATE 2025</b>: I have built a version of a palette extractor, in that it extracts ALL the CSS in the current document.  The filtering could be turned-up to just return colour data.   I have since disabled this feature as the browser reports computed unit only at runtime, so every possible unit for padding or margin gets hammered into PX.   If you run my extractor on multiple browser sizes and resolutions it returns different data each time ~ this is correct.  The source is in extra-panda <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/extra-panda/tree/main/src/extractor" target="_blank">git</a>, this feature was aborted before completion.   Purely for colours this flattening may not matter so much.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Value of a palette <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>The value of this proposed tool is</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Ease to comparing colours, to check they are balanced.</li>
    <li>Ease for comparing to a brand pack from a less technical dept. </li>
    <li>More easily compare contrasts between colours used in the whole system, in an isolated and separate fashion.</li>
    <li>Be able to test colours more easily to the current environment (i.e. take phone with palette to the tube, can you still see everything clearly, or sit in the car at night ).</li>
    <li>Be able to easily list things for contract or legal requirements, i.e. WCAG.</li>
</ul>


<details class="singlePopup">
<summary> Appendix: Browser settings that change CSS </summary>
<p>List of browser options that would make sense to change the active CSS, so maybe the attribute in the palette (currently colours):</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>text direction (ltr or rtl)</li>
    <li>screen aspect ratio probably written as aspect-ratio/ min-aspect-ratio/ max-aspect-ratio</li>

<summary> Appendix: list of CSS locations </summary>
<p>List of places to look for CSS declarations (some are stacked up, so multiple locations would need to be examined)</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>multiple CSS files problems are minimised by using compiled CSS (as stated at start).</li>
    <li>CSS elements added to the DOM header by “stylesheet per component” will be a thing that needs to be looked at, at runtime.</li>

<summary> Appendix: list of CSS selectors </summary>
<p>A list commonly used CSS selects, listed here to show the scope/ complexity / cost of CSS evaluation<br />
&lt;TODO: Add long list here&gt;</p>


</details> 
<details class="singlePopup">
<summary> Appendix: some obvious notes on extraction </summary>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>The CSS will be located as a) a stand alone asset with a .css suffix, b) a STYLE block in the HEAD c) annoyingly style attribs.  This last one is annoying, pls do not do this. Yes, you, Reactnative.</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, the palette will need to be refreshed at various time offsets after initial loading, as user activity may have added more SPA Components, so more CSS islands to the DOM.</li>
    <li>If the user has changed the browser, the active CSS will change.   This therefore would need to be recomputed.   The changes to the browser in this case, are its actual settings, the window size, the window orientation, networking status, and probably more I haven't thought of.   </li>
    <li>Anything that replaces the DOM (e.g. fast static HTML sites) may erase the currently loaded CSS and JS, so I guess a <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/js-workers#">js-workers</a> thread will need to be used to build the palette.</li>
    <li>Colours may be specified with named-colours <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, 3 octet hex colour, 6 octet hex colours, 8 octet hex colours <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, hsl <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl" target="_blank">3</a></sup> ~ is the colour model used for old analogue TV, hue <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue" target="_blank">4</a></sup> ~ has a list of other colour models: hwb(), lch(), and oklch(),  rgb(), rgba() <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/rgb" target="_blank">5</a></sup> ~ mozilla says ragba() is legacy, and write rgb() with 4 values, cymk() <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/device-cmyk" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.   Colours can be modified with filters <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter" target="_blank">7</a></sup>`</li>
    <li>BROKEN solution (1) From a flat body of CSS, regexen could be applied, sample code <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23842320/get-all-style-attribute-colors" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.  Including the full range of options is prohibitively hard (see above).  Secondly, need a way to check that this is all the CSS?   </li>
    <li>BROKEN solution (2) From a DOM, run targeted filters to extract the CSS text <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/63524883" target="_blank">9</a></sup>. The supplied code would need to be tweaked to list the CSS attachments, the CSS blocks, and the inline attributes.</li>
    <li>Solution (3) From a DOM tree, each node can be examined via <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle" target="_blank">10</a></sup> and  <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration/getPropertyValue" target="_blank">11</a></sup>.   If there is no colour set, the colour attribute will be null, otherwise it will be one of the above values.   This API returns values after CSS computation, and all the CSS is applied (so a CSS rule affecting all DIV elements would be included, and CSS specified on this DIV, and CSS inherited from parent DIVs).   </li>
    <li>As an example of extracting colours, but from images <sup><a href="https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief" target="_blank">12</a></sup> try the demo <sup><a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, second as PWA <sup><a href="https://app.color.io/" target="_blank">14</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<details class="singlePopup">
<summary> Appendix: related code </summary>
<p>I created a tool to extract the whole of the active CSS in the current webpage.   This is currently in DEV at <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/extra-panda/commit/b65409f1b4d50354b42ec352795c32d627159154" target="_blank">git</a> or with docs as <a href="https://github.com/owenBeresford/extra-panda/compare/main...ux2" target="_blank">git</a>.   This is extracting the active CSS in the DOM, regardless of its location, so I am avoiding the where is CSS” steps mentioned previously.   This outputs as a JSON blob for unit-tests, or as a CSS doc for actual CSS extraction.</p>

<p>I do not think this code is useful, as all the CSS units are translated into pixels.   I added two filters to reduce over-extraction, but further reduction steps are needed to make anything usable.   I have solved my problem via another method, and will be disabling this code.</p>
