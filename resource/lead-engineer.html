<p>This role is atypical for a contract, and is hidden behind an NDA.   I performed for Venue10, as a two line summary:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>As team-lead, co-ordinated geo-diverse development team.   Acted as product vision in places.</li>
    <li>Created/ added standard technology to improve services, towards standard outcomes.  This is not a tech-centric company.   I delivered alot of targets.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Activities for UI development <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Co-ordinating an international tech team, with people in three countries.  </li>
    <li>Managed/ lead extra remote-contractors, in several further countries.  This required managing best communication times for separate working hours.</li>
    <li>Increased stakeholder awareness and requested advise on product user-flow.</li>
    <li>Establishing standard agency work flow, with CI and concurrent git branches, moving towards weekly sprints.  The sprints are to manage task coordination between developers; weekly releases are needed as small team.  </li>
    <li>Added user-stories to improve communication and values.   Built culture of ROWE development, as I was hired after expected release date.</li>
    <li>Emphasised DDD to improve communication with non-technical directors.  Liaised directly with directors, as this is a small startup.</li>
    <li>I rebuilt the actual servers and architecture, simultaneously reducing costs and increasing performance and stability.  Managed these cloud boxes. </li>
    <li>I managed compilation/ deployment of iphone apps.</li>
    <li>We added all the SEO/ web semantics features, which for pre-commercial milestones where omitted.  Added marketing related data-features.</li>
    <li>I created and managed CORs headers.  Created some pure frontend postMessage() based communication, for other features.</li>
    <li>Created a new REST API (replacing earlier hard-to-read RPC) for better programmatic interaction.</li>
    <li>Added testing on the real time messaging feature in the booking engine, so it was shown to work with up-to 10,000 daily users.  This is a small startup, and this number was a growth target for my entire employment.   The booking engine is one of the external contracts, and expected to be a critical bottleneck for scaling.  It is expected that 90-95% of traffic will be in a 1-2h window per day.</li>
    <li>Improved OO and DB interaction for better stability.   My new code followed more recent PHP language features.</li>
    <li>For the code that I wrote, I followed standard engineering practice ~ TDD ~ as this enabled complex requirements to have timescales. </li>
    <li>The platform visibly had strong search features.  I wrote the second generation on these, replacing all previous editions.  Particularly I improved performance (about 1000%), as this had been left till the end.   Secondly focussed on usefulness and user stories, so the search was relevant to consumers.   GIS was also critical part of the search, this is purely my work.</li>
    <li>Although I did improve the search, I also moved the company's perception of search from a database resultset to a shortlist of viable options.  I moved the search filters to ones more useful to users, and tried to avoid attention on price sorting (as it was nonsense stats).  A particular meal and drinks has a defined price, but this isn't the “average price” across the venue, unless you intend to order the same meal from every venue (regardless of cuisine).</li>
    <li>In Jan 2016, I was trying to get time to implement the third generation of search, which would be faster and more of the above ideas.  </li>
    <li>Analysed and implemented a long list of UX improvements, to reduce data entry requirements for users.  This is <i>an application</i>, not a set of webforms.  In total this reduced human inputs by about 20% without any loss of features.  Changed UX widgets to ones that require less clicks.  For example there should be no need to set a [long,lat] manually, when the platform has the physical address.</li>
    <li>Did alot of “idiot testing” and found missing feedback or interactions, to make things simple from the users perspective.  I entirely defined task definition to being defined as user journeys, to reduce rate of missing interactions. </li>
    <li><b>As milestones have been achieved; I reversed the previous ROWE work style to make code easier to manage.</b></li>
    <li>Due to extending requirements I created a multi-level user authentication system.</li>
    <li>Did about several months of “no new features” quality refinement.  This lead to better UX and improved client side performance.</li>
    <li>Wrote some business features in Node.  The most complex code that I have written at that date in Node, and computed available booking slots, and characteristics of them.  Built way to generate tests quickly.  </li>
    <li>Performed code audits to improve non-functional things like API authentication; these were my most important changes done on the code that I hadn't written.</li>
    <li>Was planning on moving to Symfony for better features and performance, but this did not happen due to budget limitations/constraints.</li>
    <li>Worked on bid on TechStar accelerator funding, in the “food / hospitality tech” category. This was in the <a href="https://gust.com/accelerators/metro-accelerator-retail-by-techstars/programs/metro-accelerator-retail-by-techstars" target="_blank">incubation period</a>, <a href="https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4078685.html" target="_blank">the competition</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/week-4-techstars-brand-deliver-simon-cole/" target="_blank">Some Notes</a>.  </li>
    <li>I worked part-time for venue10 for the final two months, as most of the work was done (for example I got paid to write/ publish API documentation).  Once in my next role, I was retained for a small number of hours to perform maintenance operations.  </li>
</ul>

<p>For the first three months, my job title was “lead developer”,  afterwards I was “lead engineer”.   This role had the least software engineering work of any that I have held, due to other responsibilities.  To further the confusion, the company rebranded to dinestream.com in late 2016.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > UPDATE 2022: service is gone <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I looked at the domain; there doesn't seem to be a running service on either of these company names<br />
The most recent facebook posts are from August 2017.  I guess the auto-renew is still enabled on the domain registrar.</p>
