<p>I have a laptop that is outside of commercial release as I bought it second hand.   The fact it isn't on sale means that I can't quickly just buy a component.  My first replacement battery was mislabelled, so I need to do the research myself. #blerg<br />
<strong>My objective</strong> here is to get a battery with maximal capacity and make likely outcomes clear (I am not selling laptops or batteries).  As batteries are not the same chemicals as what was used in the 1980's and 1990's, or even 2000's any process learned then needs to be reviewed.</p>

</ul>

<p>WISH-LIST: it would be really nice if all larger batteries (over 2A I guess) would include a thermocouple, as motherboards / mainboards do.   This enables battery specific over-heating to be monitored.   I have seen PSU specific thermocouples. If you get more than X bad disk sectors, you replace the disk.  With this monitor, if you get more than X heating alerts, replace the battery ~ especially if you fly with the laptop often.</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Most laptop batteries are currently lithium ion tech <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, like phones</li>
    <li>For other electronics, there are many other battery options <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://indrakar.com/the-history-of-the-battery-from-ancient-beginnings-to-modern-innovations/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> ~ referencing the end only.   Basic reference with fancy diagrams <sup><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/breaking-it-down-next-generation-batteries" target="_blank">4</a></sup></li>
    <li>A “battery” or collection is so named <sup><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/battery" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, as it behaves like a gun battery, with cells in parallel <sup><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery" target="_blank">6</a></sup> ~ easier diagram <sup><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/take-a-look-inside-a-lithium-ion-battery-solar-panel-and-wind-turbine" target="_blank">7</a></sup> ~ more realistic structure.   A technical breakdown of manufacturing techniques for Li-ion batteries <sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258900422100300X" target="_blank">8</a></sup></li>
    <li>Current goal state ~ but not yet commercialised that I have seen is Sodium ions <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_battery" target="_blank">9</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>Modern Li-ion batteries have control circuits built in e.g. <sup><a href="https://www.sales-batteries.co.uk/toshiba-laptop/tecra-w50-a-102-battery.html" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, I assume to reduce chance of a fire, and surge protection <sup><a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/10/10/lithium-ion-battery-circuitry-is-simple/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> ~ ending comments are detailed, but lack references, or <sup><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/batteries/comments/1k0ryaq/what_does_the_bms_do_on_this_lipo_cell/" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.  This can be used to poll battery settings in addition.   Details on a model circuitry in batteries <sup><a href="https://www.caretxdigital.com/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>, or an advanced model <sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S0199859524000666" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.  Useful background reading from sparkie, unfortunately there is no part2 to be found <sup><a href="https://www.edn.com/laptop-battery-secrets-part-1/i" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.   Some notes on hacking batteries <sup><a href="https://www.batteryskills.com/can-a-laptop-battery-be-repaired/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.   </li>
    <li>The number of charge cycles advertised varies widely ~ but this range could be due to operating conditions or age of reporting.  Most Li-ion batteries support between 300 – 4000 charging cycles <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-that-a-battery-has-300-500-charge-cycles-Does-it-mean-that-the-battery-wont-perform-as-good-as-new-after-300-500-charge-cycles-or-does-it-mean-after-a-period-of-time-it-wont-be-at-its-best" target="_blank">17</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.electricity-magnetism.org/laptop-battery-en/" target="_blank">18</a></sup> ~ view with JS disabled.    This reports <sup><a href="https://evreporter.com/understanding-charge-discharge-curves-of-li-ion-cells/" target="_blank">19</a></sup> 2000 recharge cycles. The low end figures would be the battery lasting for 1-2.5 years assuming most routine work happens on battery power.  </li>
    <li>The control circuits include a count of recharge cycles.   Apple inc was prosecuted for artificially reducing the battery life via software to sell more phones (2017) <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61823512" target="_blank">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51706635" target="_blank">21</a></sup></li>
    <li>I read that Li-ion batteries do not have a memory effect, so are better rechargables.  There is confused messaging on “best practice for power”.   There is a widely recited text about 20-80% eg <sup><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/battery-works-3-ways-can-ruin/" target="_blank">22</a></sup>.  ~ which is good advice for getting a consistent voltage, see the graphs.   I have found no source of this “rule”, it's just repeated.   Research from primary sources <sup><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries" target="_blank">23</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/74243/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-batterys-cycle-life" target="_blank">24</a></sup> says run to flat is fine. <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>BUT there is some sub-system that tells you the phone battery is dead before it is dead, unless you encourage it to hit 0.   I added 12h light use by forcing it back to a better definition of 0 ~ enough for medium length calls or quite a few texts.   Doing this <em>may</em> shorten the batteries life span. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Some Li-ion batteries, on one hand, are damaged by being fully empty / flat, and won't work afterwards <sup><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/battery-works-3-ways-can-ruin/" target="_blank">25</a></sup> ~ and in my experience when left flat.  This is called “deep discharge state”.  On the other hand, bouncing to 0 isn't instantly fatal in my experience.</li>
    <li>The reason that phone batteries are shipped and sold with 40% charge is to make demos easier, and to avoid self-discharge / cell-leakage.   They do this least at about 40% charged <sup><a href="https://www.osnn.net/threads/laptop-battery-discussion-how-to-get-longest-life.98719/post-868386" target="_blank">26</a></sup>.  The 40% full avoids battery failure by being entirely flat, and battery decay.  Same technology is in laptop batteries.   </li>
    <li>For larger Li-ion batteries ~ for EV ~ fast charging will reduce battery lifespan due to “stress” ~ to paraphrase.   IMO, fast charge installation should mandate by a fire check, as the process dumps loads of heat.   Related reading <sup><a href="https://www.cantrackgps.com/news/Does-the-charging-speed-of-lithium-battery-affect-the-battery-degradation_596.html" target="_blank">27</a></sup> </li>
    <li>Stressed batteries are different to the original spec, so they store power less well.  They have a higher chance of igniting, especially in hot places like the tropics.  </li>
    <li>I wish mobiles with Li-ion batteries came with a UI that included more numbers ~ maybe in the advanced debug section.  I can easily see the version of Android, but not the charging voltage used, or battery recharge count. </li>
    <li>I wish even more technical articles described the battery technology they write about.  I have eliminated articles mentioning cars, as different operating space.</li>

    <li>Some plots of discharge capacity vs temperature <sup><a href="https://www.richtek.com/en/Design%20Support/Technical%20Document/AN024" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://poweringautos.com/how-many-charge-cycles-are-in-a-car-battery/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.ufinebattery.com/blog/how-to-read-lithium-battery-discharge-curve-and-charging-curve/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.  <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>For charging batteries, older battery technology cannot be charged at all over 45°C.  Charging a Li-ion when its hot, or storing it hot &gt;25°C will induce “stress” and shorten its charging ability.  <i>(these same references, but a new point for clarity)</i></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Fast discharging reduces batteries effective lifespan <sup><a href="https://saft.com/en/energizing-iot/lithium-ion-batteries-use-5-more-tips-longer-lifespan" target="_blank">5</a></sup></li>
    <li>The ampage used to charge or discharge affects battery lifespan, as this is “fast charge” or “fast discharge” so more abusive on the battery <sup><a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-a-higher-amp-damage-a-battery" target="_blank">6</a></sup> .   Secondly, these steps are likely to generate overheating.</li>
    <li>The charging voltage is sensitive <sup><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.   Using the manufacturer's charger is pragmatic advice.   I guess the best charging voltage is changed by the cell size.  Following <sup><a href="https://www.powerstream.com/lithium-ion-charge-voltage.htm" target="_blank">8</a></sup>, there is a floor voltage for charging, and reducing a “default change voltage of 4.2v” to 4.05v means it could support twice the number of discharges <sup><a href="https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/212988989-Re-Battery-University-article-BU-808" target="_blank">9</a></sup>.   The electronics lab used to make the data says the charging drew about 60mA.   This is less than USB-C, but may be quoted per cell, rather than per battery.  For hardware people, discussion on voltage regulation chips <sup><a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/10/10/lithium-ion-battery-circuitry-is-simple/" target="_blank">10</a></sup> used in batteries ~ I can't evaluate that, but seems relevant data.</li>
    <li>According to <sup><a href="https://www.osnn.net/threads/laptop-battery-discussion-how-to-get-longest-life.98719/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://batterlution.com/should-you-store-lithium-ion-batteries-storage-fully-charged-a-comprehensive-guide-to-storage/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> ~ the first is an older article, but still Li-ion ~ leaving batteries on the mains will reduce their lifespan.   There is supposed to be circuitry to limit this effect <sup><a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/298453/understanding-lipo-charging-protection-circuit" target="_blank">13</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>A larger battery will increase preference for fast charging systems, as without that they take a long-time to charge.  Conversely, an older battery with reduced-compared-to-initial-capacity is still useful as it was larger spec to start with.</li>
    <li>An older working-battery will discharge faster, as its max-charge is lower. See various graphs.</li>
    <li>The MTBF is how many manufactured things are logged for quality.  For a Li-ion battery there would be little chance of it exploding or burning <i>à la Teslas in the rain</i>, and the stored charge being enough just after charging. </li>
    <li>Trickle charging avoids some problems on extremes of stored charge, but still have problems XXX</li>
</ul>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>If you want to have the battery to last for as long as possible, keep the battery between 0-20°C, and charge at 3.7V.  Example, use this for spacecraft or something where swapping batteries is very expensive.  Increasing the number of cells will give you the expected ampage stored even though it will be less than other approaches.  </li>
    <li><del>If you need to maximise the power stored, and have little care for lifespan, charge at &gt;4.3V with insulation, quote `Li-Ion battery failure would occurs minutes of reaching an over charge condition ... burst/explode/catch fire depending on the type of battery` <sup><a href="https://www.osnn.net/threads/laptop-battery-discussion-how-to-get-longest-life.98719/" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.  Use for weapons where they are consumed as munitions. </del><ins>I think that idea is probably useless as it would catch fire before leaving the launcher</ins></li>
    <li>For domestic devices to live longer, charge at 3.9V, and don't let the temperature <strong>of the battery</strong> climb above 25°C.  It is important to buy the biggest battery practical, as this approach will reduce power output by nearly 30% per discharge cycle.   Repeat the temp of battery, not the surrounding laptop. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hypothetically, a long-life platform could always use low voltage charging, maybe from solar or wind power, and charge often.   As this article is about laptops, organise a battery large enough to run the laptop for a full day.  Maybe a setup with several batteries, and charge ones not being used on alternating days.  If a whole days use would flatten the reduced-output battery with the 3.9V charging, this setup SHOULD run 10-20 years without upgrades.  I write this as Moore's law <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">15</a></sup> seems to be driving computers much less than it was, so older machines are still useful.</p>

<p>Correct modelling is complex.   My source data is only moving 1 variable per data run in standard science fashion, to make results more clear.   It would be useful to have a graph of “power used per month” vs “charging habit categories”, and “all charging variables categories” vs “max charge stored” ~ this second one has sensible clusters of the variables.  I cannot add these graphs without creating the raw data, as the raw data doesn't seem to be included in the articles.</p>

<p>It is easier to get the correct battery if you have a battery firmware reader, however, this cannot easily be applied with internet shopping.  I don't know if there is a big warehouse operator for electricals/ electronics on this level (Wickes or APlant, not BandQ)</p>
