<p>A very boring list, but necessary to have a check-list.  This article seems the simplest solution.   At work previously I have changed server-side language 3 times in 2 months, and my tooling in each case was different, with different levels of maturity.   <br />
As a “after a few years” review, the easy-to-find advice is either badly audited, or incrementally increases.   I have a domestic document on this area from 2013, but that is far too old.  <br />
<b>NOTE: MSIE</b> is deprecated by Microsoft since 2022, so by and large may be ignored/ removed.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." >  An accessible internet-facing website should have <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>


<h4>Artifacts </h4>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Artifact: 'contact-us'. Yes this ties up staff, selling without communication isn't a viable process.</li>
    <li>Artifact: To comply to bits of legislation in the UK and EU, the site should declare &amp; manage cookie usage.  Nearly all of these that I have seen are a third party tool. </li>
    <li>Artifact: a sensible domain.  Whether it's best to use a “new TLD” domain, or a more traditional '.com' will vary with your product offering, and who your clients are.</li>
    <li>Artifact: terms &amp; conditions (for anything commercial).</li>
    <li>Artifact: a sitemap, for search-engines, and less traditional users (e.g. blind people).</li>
    <li>Artifact: for commercial “premise”, an anti slavery statement is useful (UK only).  Advice here <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-government-response-to-house-of-lords-committee-report/government-response-to-house-of-lords-modern-slavery-act-2015-committee-report-the-modern-slavery-act-2015-becoming-world-leading-again" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-act-statement-2024-to-2025" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/gb/en/sem/modern-slavery-statement" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Artifact: cybersecurity regulatory framework document, UK only <sup><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security-and-resilience-bill" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://emlaw.co.uk/uk-cyber-security-and-resilience-bill-overview/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>Artifact: consider if logins are actually needed.  no login= no data stored = simpler life.   Marketing people want everyone to identify themselves at every step so they are easier to sell to.   If logins are needed, consider outsourcing the process; it's not a USP or significant user-journey for nearly every business.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Extension: assuming you do need an overt identification, then could it be a SSO (ie via a social media login ~ SML ?) <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  For activities like banking were a SML is not recommended, there should be 2FA <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication" target="_blank">7</a></sup>, and consider what your second factor is with respect to ease of forgery.   I am critical of every bank that limits access constraints to a 4 or 6 digit number ~ use 15+ digits and allow a wider range of characters.   Remember “Correct Horse Battery Staple” as an example of an authenticator that is easier for English-speaking-humans than machines <sup><a href="https://xkcd.com/936/?correct=horse&amp;amp;battery=staple" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.   As a human-centric checksum, choosing passwords that you could transmit via voice comms means humans can manipulate it more reliably, but please do not transmit your authenticator.   Using multiple words means dictionary-based attacks become poor again.  This supports the above cybersecurity notes.</li>
        <li>I think it should be standard practice to include a non-US ASCII-127 letter in your passphrases ~ so '£' in the UK ~ as this localises the range of people who can can type this.   Not that hacking tools need to type.   Note hotels whilst on holiday may not have the expected keyboard layouts.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Artifact: role-based access-control (RBAC) is recommended, as it allows more tuned user journeys to user needs.   This supports the above cybersecurity notes.</li>
    <li>Artifact: If the site is a sales platform / landing-&gt;lead funnel, add standard SEO features (I don't normally make these manually; stereotypically use a wordpress plugin).</li>
    <li>Artifact: Accessibility notes, please browse requirements in <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/accessibility-testing#">accessibility-testing</a></li>
    <li>Artifact: social media channels, communication doesn't need to be limited to the oldest technology.   Your support team / sales team / accounts team who do customer interactions should be able to do this via SM channels also.  Prefer direct messages, so your customers wont publish email / bankaccount etc to the internet. </li>
    <li>Suggested Artifact, not required but makes communication more clear: copyright statement, mentioning owner, date, and ideally a form of contact.</li>
    <li>Cookie terms and privacy statement.  This item is mostly for the UK and EU.  Blah, your staff will already have an opinion here...</li>
    <li><b>IDEA</b>, Transitional artifact, <b>IDEA</b> used as a cue that the page is still loading, but can be interacted with, I think it's nice to have a temp banner message “loading assets” or similar.  It is more correct that the App useful status is achieved faster rather than annotated, but the message is useful for automated testing.  If a CSS content is set with font declarations, then suppressed after images, fonts and JS advertising plugins have executed, then there is better clarity on quality.   Important to <strong>note: do not block users while assets are initialising.</strong></li>
</ul>

<summary><h4>Tech features </h4></summary>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Tech: HTTPS access, and headers to force HTTPS, [1] and also see HSTS below<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>This applies twice as hard to internal communications.  If there is a precise SSL setup to talk to your DB, but only 3 machines are allowed to do this, its a quality filter.   Allowing elderly copies of Android to access your systems allows better customer service, but allowing the same to your DB instance is nonsense.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: using HTML5 properly, pls see recently added tags if unaware <sup><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_new_tags.htm" target="_blank">1</a></sup> or all tags <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li><i>HTM5</i> is less well supported for MSIE, but we do not use that anymore.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: Content-Type widely used header. Mentioned here as the charset clause should be present to limit an escalation attack e.g. <i>Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8</i>. </li>
    <li>Tech: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" target="_blank">HTTP 404</a> handler [2]</li>
    <li>Tech: a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500" target="_blank">HTTP 5*</a> handler [2]</li>
    <li>Tech: a <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt" target="_blank">robots.txt</a> <sup><a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Recommend blocking search engine access to any URLs which are not content centric (e.g. contact-me)</li>
        <li>supported browsers: approximately all.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: if you use a cheap domain host, Google sometimes gets confused about domain details.  Add a canonical link for index / home pages to de-confuse it <sup><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/canonical-url-guide/" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://moz.com/blog/heres-how-to-generate-and-insert-rel-canonical-with-google-tag-manager" target="_blank">6</a></sup></li>

        <li>supported browsers: 93.21% nearly all <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=content%20type%20option" target="_blank">7</a></sup> Absent from opera and minority browsers.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: for branding, a favicon.XXX image; note there are a range of formats that can be supported.    Pls see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/favicon-notes#">favicon-notes</a> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>supported browsers: A standard setup is 3-4 file formats, supplying a very good coverage.  Single file formats have something like 80% <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=favicon" target="_blank">8</a></sup> </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: Asset compression [3], the process of making all the files as small as possible, so they will download faster.  Very important when 2g and 3g was how “fashionable sales people” used the internet. <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>supported browsers: all, compressed assets follow the same rules as non-compressed ones</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2" target="_blank">HTTP2</a> and to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade" target="_blank">upgrade</a> to HTTP2.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>supported browsers: 97.13% nearly all, outliers are [4] </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control" target="_blank">Cache-Control</a> <sup><a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http-cache-headers" target="_blank">9</a></sup> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires" target="_blank">Expires</a> <sup><a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http-cache-headers" target="_blank">10</a></sup><ul class="ulbasic">

        <li><a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/http-cache-breaker#">http-cache-breaker</a></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: relevant flavours of rich snippets / meta data, to improve accessibility to your data by both users and search engines.   Again, this is too big for a bullet point, see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/webpage-micro-data#">webpage-micro-data</a> <ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>supported browsers: broad as this is a decade old technology, see link for more details.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: Analytics, if it's inside your user-cases.  When websites are sales pipelines, this is essential.  I previously wrote <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/current-gA#">current-gA</a> - 2018 or for in-house analytics <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/analytics-2#">analytics-2</a><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>supported browsers: all</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech: asset headers (like MIME for JS with UTF8)<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>support varies, but very good in aggregate</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Tech admin: Analysis of logging, so any errors can be resolved promptly.  If you are using a website as an active communication channel with your users; this is essential.</li>

<summary><h4> [5] Longer notes on CSP header(s) </h4></summary>
<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>As another security header, I went to a lecture on CSP / Content-Security-policy in 2017 (guess on the date).  This is an extension to reduce computers being literal minded and allowing data too complex for human over-watch.  However, as with many of these mechanisms, the complexity is now on one place, and is too complex for humans.   </li>
    <li>Examples <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62105213/setting-content-security-policy-in-apache-web-server" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68886438/why-should-we-include-csp-headers-in-the-http-response-for-an-api#68911235" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>CSP, <sup><a href="https://content-security-policy.com/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> ~ eponymous website.  <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank">4</a></sup>, <sup><a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/04/how-to-set-up-a-content-security-policy-csp-in-3-steps.html" target="_blank">5</a></sup>, practical advice on Nonce values <sup><a href="https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/" target="_blank">6</a></sup>, and CSP as a HTML META tag <sup><a href="https://centralcsp.com/articles/page/csp-meta-tags" target="_blank">7</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li>OWASP opinion on CSP <sup><a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">8</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>For an inline SCRIPT tag, the CSP <i>nonce</i> or <i>hash</i> attributes will need to be set, and AFAICT, dynamically at the server.   </li>
    <li>As CSP is quite large, I pulled up reference implementations.  For example if using Express, try Helmet <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet" target="_blank">npm</a> plugin.   The docs attached to the NPM page are quite detailed. Nextjs has a page on this <sup><a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, but no module that I saw.   For Golang, a vendor's package <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/csp/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">git</a>, another implementation <a href="https://github.com/srikrsna/security-headers" target="_blank">git</a>, manual assignment <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25028441/how-do-i-set-multi-value-http-headers-like-content-security-policy" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   For Python, if using Flask ~ try Talisman module <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/flask-talisman" target="_blank">git</a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/talisman/" target="_blank">pypi</a>, or Django ~ the django-csp module <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp" target="_blank">git</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-csp/" target="_blank">pypi</a> <sup><a href="https://www.laac.dev/blog/content-security-policy-using-django/" target="_blank">11</a></sup>. </li>
    <li>#TODO It would be a useful security maquette to try to force a script tag to have a valid CSP, when it was added by scripting on the client side.</li>
    <li>#TODO Workout how-to do some sort of Eslint plugin for CSP, maybe not Eslint specifically, but a rules processor with a UI that validates text formats.  Due to the complexity to have a fully operational CSP security filter, I strongly recommend some sort of unit-test for it specifically, on the app level.   This is twice as urgent if you have many deployment environments or source JS from many domains.</li>

<summary><h4> Front-end performance improvements </h4></summary>
<p>I started this list as tidy-ups I have done on older established sites, and I just kept writing.   I am defining performance as reducing content-reflows and render cost then reducing work measured in download bytes and time to display content.   It is more difficult to write similar backend list, as there are many non-overlapping technologies available. These boring but reliable performance improvements should be present by-default in frameworks and app kits, but your millage may vary:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Use PICTURE <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture" target="_blank">1</a></sup> to select image to screen size and orientation, supported by 97.8% <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=picture" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Check value supplied by any JS plugins, especially if you / your team controls local source.</li>
    <li>Move fonts declarations to head of CSS, or maybe in HTML HEAD.  Prune fonts formats to ones needed and supported.   Favour local static hosting fonts, over dynamically generated ones, from another continent.   A minor change to lettering appearance is much less urgent than fonts-for-iconsets.   Fonts are a universe in their own right, see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/web-font-2024#">web-font-2024</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/utf8-richtext-maquette#">utf8-richtext-maquette</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/fonts-ideal#">fonts-ideal</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/colourise-emoji#">colourise-emoji</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/symbol-tools#">symbol-tools</a>.  Supported browser ranges are listed in the attached articles.   </li>
    <li>Where this works with the design, favour UTF8 glyths for icons over an image.  AND favour a SVG image over a JPEG / Bitmap or similar image.   The UTF8 will be 1-4 bytes, and entirely inline but the image is often over a thousand bytes.  The UTF8 will mostly match the colour scheme as a free step.  I would suggest using default fonts for the UTF8 symbols, as not every font has every glyth.  Look at <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/colourise-emoji#">colourise-emoji</a>, for handling and limitations.</li>
    <li>There are various bits of technology that were innovative and added value when they were written (most likely in JS), but now should be replaced with a browser feature.  Remove the old “cool tech”, as it now just junk dead-code  eg, ie-shim.js should be removed with extreme prejudice, MSIE is removed by Microsoft on all machines with updates.  Test carefully when making these removals.   A properly loading JS Shim will assist the odd user that needs it, but more features are being moved into the w3c browser “widely supported” baseline standard.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Any full-screen image display widget in JS can be replaced by a few lines of CSS, and save download capacity, see <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/modal-popover#">modal-popover</a>, <a href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/zoomable-widget#">zoomable-widget</a>.  </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Try preloading essential iconset fonts / images for diagrams / CSS libs directly in the HTML HEAD with LINK rel=“preload” <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content.html" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49981075" target="_blank">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64499667" target="_blank">6</a></sup>.  There are “solutions” describing making LINK elements with preload via JS.   However, by the time the JS has been downloaded and parsed, it's not the early loading phase anymore ~ so I'm not sure how this helps.   This tech is supported by 96.02% of browsers <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=rel%3Dpreload" target="_blank">7</a></sup></li>
    <li>Use loading=lazy <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading" target="_blank">8</a></sup> and height / width attributes on IMG elements, so the image(s) can be loaded last, but nothing will reflow.   Currently supported by 96.31% of browsers <sup><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=loading%3Dlazy" target="_blank">9</a></sup></li>
    <li>Reduce animation to the most import bit, rather than all over.  Animation reduces readability, and the further we travel from 1995 the less people are impressed by it.   For the important animation, platforms like MaterialUI are great for consistency and being able to deliver story points quickly, BUT maybe a little bit of CSS is smaller and faster e.g. <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.   There are other technologies that could be used, but my point is, good DX often isn't performant.   </li>
    <li>Look at when each Element is rendered, and if these are in the right order.  The order can be managed with various CSS declarations XXX XXX  <sup><a href="https://web.dev/blog/css-content-visibility-baseline" target="_blank">11</a></sup></li>
    <li>Bundling and splitting CSS into <i>“all the CSS for this app/site and mobile and portrait”</i>, then <i>“all the CSS for this app/site and tablet and landscape”</i>, and <i>“all the CSS for this app/site and a big screen”</i> may help reduce download volumes if the CSS is different in each case.  This isn't true in all apps / sites.   The screen orientation is the important metric, but the precise visualisations created should match your users, not some online notes.  Assuming your CSS works in this architecture, media queries can be added to the STYLE element, so only relevant CSS is downloaded.  There are many text centric sites where multiple files would be nearly identical so this step buys nothing.   To reduce risk, there should be a default “catchall” style sheet with a flexible RWD / liquid layout.  <strong>This needs to be a compile step</strong>, or the render testing will be very lengthy. Try <i>PurgeCSS</i> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss" target="_blank">npm</a> <a href="https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss" target="_blank">git</a>, or <i>PurityCSS</i> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/purify-css" target="_blank">npm</a> <a href="https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss" target="_blank">git</a>  <sup><a href="https://www.corewebvitals.io/pagespeed/fix-remove-unused-css-lighthouse" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://webup.org/blog/react-device-based-code-split/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.</li>
    <li>Look at the HTML after all the technology has happened.  Try to migrate to use HTML DIALOG and DETAILS / SUMMARY with relevant CSS, as these are smoother, more secure, smaller, and faster than some 3rd party SPA Component.   For modern CSS, many features in a HTML SELECT can be styled, so migrating to a real SELECT box is probably better UX.   </li>
    <li>Encourage marketing-centric plugins to load after the actual content.   For certain vendors, I edit their JS snippet to use a DOM loadevent, then a small setTimeout, rather than HTML3 onload event.   This means users get an interactive page load time that is 4-5s faster.</li>
    <li>Check for usage of legacy features based on CSS margins, as this caused page reflows.   Try CSS <i>flex</i> <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex" target="_blank">14</a></sup> or <i>flex-grid</i> <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.   These should be a feature of your CSS framework.  Assume global support for each CSS option mentioned in this paragraph.   I don't have experience with CSS float making reflows, but that should be deprecated also.   </li>
    <li>Eliminate non-visible white-space from your HTML for production use on SSR or static sites.  There are plugins for your framework, and/or a regex over the source code that makes the HTML.   If you are using an SPA, this step is not important.</li>
    <li>Ensure everything in minified correctly, and trees are shaken (i.e. check the file rather than looking at the file suffix). #leSigh Check fonts are compressed when they say they are. #leSigh Check images have correct resolution, correct JPEG compression and correct palette size, again #leSigh.  In many cases, diagram-type images are smaller as SVG, but photo-type images need to be either WEBP or JPEG2000.  I assert that there are no dodgy small resolution JPEGs for anything recent, so the newer format is better <sup><a href="https://blog.idrsolutions.com/how-to-choose-jpg-versus-jpeg2000-for-image-files/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.   Keep measuring everything. </li>
    <li>I haven't mentioned deprecate table-based layouts from the early noughties with extreme prejudice... but do so if found.</li>
</ul>

<p>Footer notes<br />
Note there are Golang HTTP middleware frameworks which ship without HTTP 404 or 500 support “for free”.</p>

<ol>
    <li>[1] Specific notes to force HTTPS depend on what server software you are using.   Use a search engine.</li>
    <li>[2] Linking to Wiki, as each different framework would be a different article to read.  As far as this is a problem spec not a solution, I think this is the least stupid option for anyone who doesn't know what these errors mean.</li>
    <li>[3] Again specific notes depend on your technology.  A popular search term is “minify”.  There are a large number of tools to support this process.</li>
    <li>[4] The outliers are consistently old MSIE, which no-one should ever use for a very long list of problems; and opera mini, as the feature contradicts the major objectives of this niche browser.</li>
