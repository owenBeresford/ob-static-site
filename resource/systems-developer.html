<p>The role covers April 2004 till Oct 2010.   I was employed as a software engineer, I helped move a company from an ad-hoc software creation, to a structured development process at murphX.  The company was focused on the reseller market for internet bandwidth.  The company had an efficient sales force, and was awarded in a number of places, to quote the commercial directors linked-in profile “murphx was voted ISP of the Year at the Comms Business Awards 2009 and has been listed in Sunday Times Microsoft Tech Track 100, 2009, Deloitte Fast 50 and Deloitte Fast 500 EMEA as one of the fastest growing technology companies in the UK”.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this period, the telephony side of the company had been bought by Daisy plc, and is no longer a separate trading entity to the best of my knowledge.  After I left, the original development team, under the CTO was formed as new company ~ called murja ~ as a pure software services company.   This still seems to be in a turbulent state, and that leaving at that point was a smart idea.   He seems to have closed the spin-off company in 2017.</p>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc0"> <a href="#toc0" title="Jump to this section." > Responsibilities/ deliveries <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I created and delivered the following:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Developed solutions for many business goals, created many narrow products and features of larger suites.  Created monitoring and availability for the products;</li>
    <li>Primary author for the majority of the company's business-logic between 2004-2010.  Wrote SOAs that formed several three tier B2B and B2C portals.   Created full provisioning life-cycle for DSL services;</li>
    <li>Integrated with a wide range of external vendors' provisioning systems (where the API had a range of maturity before service contracts where signed);</li>
    <li>Created and managed early-web payment systems from several providers, supported many tier billing/ invoicing, and performed automated payments;</li>
    <li>Standard software engineering process to reduce risk, increase delivery rate, audit, and half-automate documentation of artifacts;</li>
    <li>Vastly created and extended personalisation on external facing communications (email, texts, authentication interstitials)</li>
    <li>At this telco, I developed RADIUS, L2TP, LCP, VoIP stack, IP routing + management, QOS, SMTP + related, SMS, early AJAX, email-fax integration, XML (several flavours), SQL (several flavours), data-caching, HTML, RPM, troff, expect, PDF, bash </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Learning <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>This was my first real job.  When I joined I was very shy and insecure. In hindsight, I would have behaved the way I do now for the whole period, but that is quite difficult.  <br />
I learned a lot about practical project management and status delivery; my work improved my project tracking and requirements analysis skills.<br />
I gained lots of technical experience, but this wasn't an enterprise employer for the majority of its life.</p>
