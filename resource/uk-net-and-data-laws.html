<p><b>Expected audience:</b> software engineers who have clients/ bosses in the UK.   This is the most “senior engineer article” on this site to-date.   This article is extensive, therefore quite long.</p>

<p>The current Tory administration is working to improve the currency and relevancy of UK law regarding “dem interweb finngies”.   A longer version of this text would reference the educational attainments of the people proposing the laws, and so a basic observation of their domain knowledge.   Some UK law is well written/ wise, e.g. the law regulating the public carrying of random things that seem to indicate premeditated violence, the current state <sup><a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/offensive-weapons-knives-bladed-and-pointed-articles" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, but my initial statement was thinking about the 1950's edition <sup><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/14/2023-02-07" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.   This is a factual article, I will edit until this is as objective as other texts on this site.</p>


<div class="pullout">
<p>Note <i>con sottovoci</i>, an actual Tory MP, in Parliament (their place of work) claimed they used “dem interwebs finngies” so badly, whilst they were looking for notes about Tractors for an Agricultural proposal, they accidentally mis-tapped and looked at pron for a while, got called up for it; then did the same thing again <sup><a href="https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/uk-news/tractorgate-mp-stand-down-after-26840254" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-tory-neil-parish-quits-26839237" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.  I do not look at pron at work (or otherwise), I work hard instead.</p>


</div>
<p>Domain jargon: work-in-progress is called a <b>bill</b>, a completed piece is called an <b>act</b> <sup><a href="https://righttoremain.org.uk/whats-the-difference-between-a-bill-and-an-act/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.   The initial step / call to arms / plan is called a <b>white paper</b>.   I believe the two later steps are published on different coloured paper.   Unelected and unaccountable 'Think tanks' ~ which are not part of the government ~ also make white papers.  The <b>CPS</b> is the Crown Prosecution Service <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prosecution_Service" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, the organisation that enforces criminal law in the UK, other countries have “public prosecutors” instead.   As a smaller thing than an Act, there are “UK Statutory Instruments” (SI).  These have narrower activity scope and are often narrower in terms of geography.  This text list Acts, rather than SI.  The <b>UKG</b> is my abbreviation for “United Kingdom government” whilst being vague about which one.  What's “pron”?  It's a spoonerism, there is at least 1 really stupid content filter that fails to know that “talking about X without showing it” is not the same as “here is lots of X”, please read <sup><a href="https://www.knowyourmobile.com/user-guides/a-complete-list-of-sites-that-are-banned-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/verhuetung-erst-ab-18-deutschlands-wichtigster-jugendschutz-filter-blockiert-hilfsangebote/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> ~ the second link is from DE, but same limited tech applies. <i>NOTE: this article is about UK laws, it's perfectly child-safe and has no pictures/videos at all.</i></p>

        <li>before the 17th century, the monarch regulated printing presses by granting monopolies (see wiki). </li>
        <li>As a developer, you need to know that some things in the UK may not be copied, except via an official process.  The most notable items are OS maps, and birth certificates.  The second point is why no finance identity check uses a birth cert.   </li>

<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > To show a new website isn't pron  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>I am adding this section, as I previously worked for a new startup, who, when they made their first edition sales funnel which was quite bland, was blocked.  The first version of the website text was made by a UK barrister, as this startup was his sidejob.   Barristers are obviously precise with wording.   My ISP which is on default settings, described it as pron.   As far as I know that domain had never previously be registered by other organisations.   So ISPs “intelligent blocking”, is actually “new domain blocking”, which is easier, but not very smart.</p>

<p>The activity list for a new company site is:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Buy and setup domain, </li>
    <li>Make it not blocked by ISPs, </li>
    <li>get content added, also see <a class="" href="https://owenberesford.me.uk/resource/seo#">seo</a> </li>
    <li>get HTTPS established</li>
    <li>add SEO DNS headers, HTTP headers, HTML headers, assets, etc</li>
    <li>added to search engines</li>
    <li><del>spam</del><ins>promote</ins> presence in SM</li>
    <li>if needed, add PPC adverts  </li>
</ul>

<p>To be able to see if your website is currently being blocked, view the <a href="https://www.blocked.org.uk/" target="_blank">open rights group checker</a>.  In the UK, being blocked here, will limit 3.5 million households and many mobile connections from being able to view your legitimate business.  <br />
There are 10 major ISPs serving the UK <sup><a href="https://www.techradar.com/broadband/which-are-the-most-popular-internet-service-providers-in-the-uk" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/providers/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> (noting 'relabel brands' grow quickly).   A total count of ISPs is at 232 <sup><a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/isp_list/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.ispa.org.uk/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> at point of publication.   The process to get listed as 'not Pron' at the ISP level, on each of the following:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>BT</b> in 2022, the process to get a single site unblocked was emailing <i>saferbrowsing@bt.com</i>, and describing your site <sup><a href="https://community.bt.com/t5/Home-setup-Wi-Fi-network/Our-website-seems-to-be-blocked-by-BT/td-p/2233592" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.   </li>
    <li><b>TalkTalk</b>  For generic concerns Talktalk operate <i>concerns@talktalkplc.com</i> <sup><a href="https://www.talktalk.co.uk/media/pdf/legal/TalkTalk_Customer_Complaints_Code_v20180110.pdf" target="_blank">6</a></sup> (terms published 2021).</li>
    <li><b>Sky</b>  The sky help website supplies a contact of <i>mysky@sky.uk</i> that they say can be used by business owners to get their own site reclassified <sup><a href="https://www.sky.com/help/articles/sky-broadband-shield-sites-not-filtering-correctly" target="_blank">7</a></sup> ~ this has no publish date, so I assume for today's date.  There is a list of major sites that they block <sup><a href="https://www.sky.com/help/articles/our-approach-to-protecting-copyright" target="_blank">8</a></sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Virgin Media</b> the community <sup><a href="https://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Security-matters/Website-Blocked/td-p/5255669" target="_blank">9</a></sup> says email <i>websafefeedback@virginmedia.co.uk</i> or use <a href="https://my.virginmedia.com/my-apps/onlinesecurity/websafe/feedback" target="_blank">virgin tools</a>, if you are a customer.  Posted in 2023.  They also list the “websites blocked by order of a UK Court” <sup><a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/help/list-of-court-orders" target="_blank">10</a></sup>.  </li>
    <li><b>Plusnet</b> <a href="https://www.plus.net/help/" target="_blank">Support team</a>, some data about process <sup><a href="https://community.plus.net/t5/My-Router/Router-Blocking-a-website/td-p/1780881" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/parental-controls/broadband-mobile/plusnet-safeguard/" target="_blank">12</a></sup>.</li>
    <li><b>Vodafone</b> For Vodafone, it seems you need to raise a <a href="https://forum.vodafone.co.uk/t5/Network-queries/Unblock-my-website/td-p/2734209/page/3" target="_blank">support ticket</a> (this does cover the same data capture process as the other ISPs) <sup><a href="https://rechargevodafone.co.uk/how-to-unblock-sites-on-vodafone-broadband-the-ultimate-guide/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>. </li>
    <li><b>NOW Broadband</b>, <a href="https://www.cable.co.uk/broadband/providers/now-broadband/contact/" target="_blank">support details</a>, doesn't show on Blocked.org,uk's list, maybe below minimum size. </li>
    <li><b>Shell Energy Broadband</b> ~ <a href="https://www.shellenergy.co.uk/contact-us/broadband" target="_blank">Support team</a>.  This vendor will become part of TalkTalk soon, and I can't find a process described.  </li>
    <li><b>Hyperoptic</b> This seems an adhoc process, but <i>support@hyperoptic.com</i> <sup><a href="https://www.hyperoptic.com/faq/posts/why-cant-i-access-certain-websites/" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.  Not on blocked.og,uk's list.</li>
    <li><b>Gigaclear</b> This seems like a small ISP, <a href="https://www.gigaclear.com/support" target="_blank">their support details</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Community Fibre</b> is a greater London ISP, and some of Essex <sup><a href="https://theroams.co.uk/providers/community-fibre/network/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>, their <a href="https://help.communityfibre.co.uk/troubleshooting/wifi-and-broadband-troubleshooting" target="_blank">support link</a>.  They state they cover a “large city” of Forest gate <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Forest+Gate,+London/@51.5465466,0.0197899,15z/" target="_blank">map</a>.   </li>
    <li><b>KCOM</b> is a regional ISP (is part of the Hull exception).  Access for support is from <sup><a href="https://www.kcom.com/home/help/" target="_blank">16</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://theroams.co.uk/providers/kcom/customer-service/" target="_blank">17</a></sup>, I can't find anything for law mandated censoring.   </li>
</ul>

<p>This is a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">well known sites</a> that have been blocked in the UK.   The reason for blocking makes the process look quite manual, also another example <sup><a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/24/incident-report-some-gov-uk-urls-blocked-by-deceptive-site-warning/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.   <br />
The list of default blocking by UK ISPs is <sup><a href="https://www.blocked.org.uk/stats/probes" target="_blank">19</a></sup>.   There has been fairly organised work by Media Studios, to block access to major pirate sites <sup><a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/10/six-big-uk-isps-ordered-to-block-five-piracy-streaming-websites.html" target="_blank">20</a></sup>.<br />
Whilst building the list of ISPs, I got this list of tools, which claim to validate resources used by your website</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><a href="https://dnschecker.org/" target="_blank">DNS checker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.urlvoid.com/" target="_blank">URL void</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ssltrust.co.uk/ssl-tools/website-security-check" target="_blank">SSL trust</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.fortiguard.com/webfilter" target="_blank">Fortisguard</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming your site is virtuous, not being filtered by Google's <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/" target="_blank">safebrowsing API</a> is wise, the webmaster side notes for this are <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/security/malware?hl=en&amp;amp;" target="_blank">21</a></sup>.   Links to Google webmaster tools <sup><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/?hl=en#topic=9128571" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search" target="_blank">23</a></sup><br />
Bing is the second biggest search in the UK, but much smaller.  Having a profile on Bing web tools is constructive <sup><a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/add-and-verify-site-12184f8b" target="_blank">24</a></sup>.  Some sites are blocked, see <sup><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/how-to-unblock-website-on-bing/df7f9d42-4872-4a11-bdca-c0b4aad4a02b" target="_blank">25</a></sup>.</p>
