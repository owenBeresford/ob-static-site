<p>It is more honest to call SEO one of the following “letting tech people not use crap tech” or “content librarianship”.  Any good search engine will return content that the user requested.  Users want content, not vague marketing pitches.   A good traditional librarian will ensure that all the books are present, that they are in good condition, and they are the current edition, that they are in the expected location on the shelves.  Lastly that the books are worth reading.  Applying these same rules or conditions to websites makes them much more useful.</p>

<p>There are many websites which mostly contain marketing whoffle.  Marketeers hyping to other marketeers is even worse, it's incredibly vague, emotive and suggestive <sup><a href="https://www.copyblogger.com/does-my-content-suck/" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://alphametic.com/content-marketing-services-2" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://seo-hacker.com/5-reasons-why-people-bite-on-linkbaits/" target="_blank">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://blog.influenceandco.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-captivating-content" target="_blank">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/why-your-facebook-ads-shouldnt-be-blue/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  For comparison developers hand out tools and libraries that others may use.   The most valuable libraries automate things that you need to do really often, that are annoying, banal and dull (e.g. GIT).</p>


<div class="pullout">

<h4 class="dontend" id="toc1"> <a href="#toc1" title="Jump to this section." > Define “vague and suggestive”? <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>I accept the fact that with information systems I am very boring, uncool; but I am fairly clear and structured.  <br />
Poor marketing is like the following made-up examples:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li><b>Model photo + “10 ways a washing machine improved my life in Sunny Spain &quot;</b> (posted in a dull Feb in the UK, with a UK centric brand)<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>why: is quite vague about washing machines, and the article could equally be applied to any to the competitors, with a simple change in logo.  Therefore as the end user, how does this help me choose a washing machine?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Spending alot of effort on collateral to <b>get people to confuse YYY washing machine with sports and “summer fun”</b><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>why: this breaks communication and language.   As we very rarely talk about buying washing machines, we don't need lots of words to do this. This example is short on facts.   Most people do not think of laundry as “summer fun”, and also do not do sports in-order to do the laundry afterwards.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Sales collateral where the <b>only fact is that you won a best of breed award.</b><ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>why: the current vendor was the only contender for that award.  Again, no facts.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<p><i>“I don't buy washing machines, but when I do, I want actual numbers”</i> [apologies to that meme photo of an old guy in a pin stripe suit holding a beer].</p>

<p>Data should be presented with a metric that other people also use.  Without any funny distortion on number formats.  Just like your internal sales reports. <br />
I really cannot imagine buying a washing machine on a casual whim, or because you thought the sales person had a nice smile.  A non-vague and suggestive washing machine infomercial ~ due to subject, I suspect that an infomercial is the best format, which would:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>List details compared to public external metrics; like EU power efficiency ratings</li>
    <li>Have up-to-date numbers for this washing machine and the competition; if this is a very wash-volume optimised machine, state this</li>
    <li>Should describe the user interface, maybe via screenshots</li>
    <li>If you have no actual USP, you will need to compete on price</li>
</ul>

<p>This is referencing items that people buy rarely, have low awareness of, and cannot be sold as “life style purchase”.  Items like this really need good marketing.<br />
Note: last time I did buy a washing machine, one of the options had a special slot; so if you discovered a random sock after you had started a load, you could put the sock in that wash.  This is innovative and a good USP, but we didn't buy that machine.</p>


</div>
<p>Precise notes on SEO change all the time, but the big meta rule remains: make websites useful to users, and give them something that they want.  Contrary to what various marketeers think, most users are not burdened by too much money that they are unsure how to get rid of.  <br />
One could write suggestions such as: ensure pages load quickly, ensure they look snappy on a variety of machines, they are easy to understand then navigate, ensure they work with intermittent net connection, ensure they work if you are colour blind.  [and so on.]  I think this list is quite obvious.  Basically users aren't sitting in front of a souped-up mac, with a second screen, and a 100MB net connection, in a decent office; they don't have your education, or good colour vision.  They are sitting on the tube, on the end of their battery, exchanging an argument via SMS with their partner; before a big meeting.  ...And also looking at your site.  If your site is still useful in the real world, then you are good at SEO ~ yes this is what search engines are trying to measure.  The previous sentence is focussed on use of the site, rather than discovery of the site; but the trip via google would need to work for any new visitors.  Google is more likely to return sites that are technically useful to users.<br />
A term used in app development is PWA ~ progressive web app; I think the underlying concept of <em>'deliver the core proposition and as many frills as possible'</em> should be applied everywhere.  If your user is currently using dead-time, but is in a hostile lighting environment, they can still read your text and that should be all they need.  Other users can watch your videos, but don't force all users to have the same access path.</p>

<p>Marketing people have invented various pyramid schemes for popularity, described <sup><a href="https://designhammer.com/blog/17-black-hat-seo-techniques-avoid" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.  An example of a link trap tagged inside a google cache: <sup><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:c2mLl6vdBRYJ:www.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjaysondemers%2F2014%2F08%2F25%2Fthe-12-essential-elements-of-high-quality-content%2F%20&amp;amp;cd=5&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk" target="_blank">2</a></sup> (the forbes site is still live, but its annoying)</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > Google's process, 2015 <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>Google inc is not the only place for information retrieval, but is a highly prominent one.  The actual market is more tangled than <em>naïf</em> analysis would indicate, as Google inc supplies search services for other search engines.   I am quoting 2015 as that was when I needed this article ~ as research for me ~ also I saw “roll-outs finally finished” on Penguin and Panda.  I looked <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/library/platforms/google/google-algorithm-updates" target="_blank">3</a></sup> (scroll 2/3 way down), both these changes where in many steps.  Panda was 29 steps ending in 2015, Penguin was 8 steps ending in 2014. <br />
If you are not a marketeer, what Google says is generally common sense.  They want to serve end-users results that work, are relevant, are current, and are correct (in the sense that if you say you sell Mondeos, you actually sell them).   If you are a marketeer, Google is an elephant in the room, who keeps changing the rules. Google keeps blocking marketeers' dragnets, as they weaken the search results.  Marketeers do things like making-up blogs, to fill with “link juice” <sup><a href="https://adpearance.com/blog/applying-constant-vigilance-in-the-war-against-webspam/" target="_blank">4</a></sup> for their own brands primary site <sup><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/07/15/how-to-find-and-drain-link-juice" target="_blank">5</a></sup>.  In a less-marketeer-speak; try to link to the primary site, suggesting concepts about the primary site that may or may not be true.</p>

<p>Before 2015, Google released a few new editions of their search algorithm, the updates where called Penguin <sup><a href="http://provenrankings.com/in-the-aftermath-of-penguin-2-0-branding-is-now-a-huge-ranking-factor/" target="_blank">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-algorithm-changes-210285" target="_blank">7</a></sup> and Panda <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-panda-penguin-realtime-218407" target="_blank">8</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-forecloses-on-content-farms-with-farmer-algorithm-update-66071" target="_blank">9</a></sup> respectively.  There were many words written on marketing blogs about how this was going to disrupt many marketing schemes.  Marketeers had apparently prematurely optimised to a particular piece of technology <sup><a href="https://www.woorank.com/en/blog/panda-penguin-hummingbird-a-guide-to-feared-googles-zoo" target="_blank">10</a></sup>, and now needed to revert.  Marketeers where not impressed <sup><a href="https://seomelbourne.com/video/how-does-the-penguin-update-affect-your-content-strategy/" target="_blank">11</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.linkdex.com/en-gb/inked/google-penguin-3-0-5-things-cmos-need-to-know/" target="_blank">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2013/08/07/google-panda-penguin-phantom-3-recovery-examples/" target="_blank">13</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-penguin-3-0-worldwide-rollout-still-process-impacting-1-english-queries-206286" target="_blank">14</a></sup>.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc3"> <a href="#toc3" title="Jump to this section." > Google's process, 2022 <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>More recently, Google policy states it is strongly promoting good content, even Google ads will not promote you as high (they say) <sup><a href="https://www.madebyfactory.com/white-hat-vs-black-hat-seo/" target="_blank">15</a></sup>.  Good quality writing is a factor used in good content <sup><a href="https://qr.ae/prYnkf" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.   To improve sales for AMP and Pagespeed they talk about “site speed” quite often <sup><a href="https://roiminds.com/white-hat-seo-techniques-to-double-your-search-traffic/" target="_blank">17</a></sup> and this speed is focused on mobile.   All the historic farming/ “black SEO” methods they claim are detected and penalised, as Google thinks if you had good content you wouldn't need to pay for the farming.  It is recommended to align the keywords used in your site with “average American English” keywords, so when a user searches they get results <sup><a href="https://mediaberry.io/white-hat-seo/" target="_blank">18</a></sup>.  For everything after about 2013, having your content work on a phone is strongly recommended, as many people will be accessing via this since the average user has changed.   It is recommended <sup><a href="https://markitors.com/best-white-hat-seo-hacks/" target="_blank">19</a></sup> to have a simple and clear design, presumably so pages can be scanned quickly.   'Local search' is a good strategy <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/local-seo/" target="_blank">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7091?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">21</a></sup> if you are selling physical goods that need to be delivered or collected. <br />
For a detailed look at Google's publicly accessible change list, try <sup><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/" target="_blank">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/ranking" target="_blank">23</a></sup>.   Recently Google has a [probably internal] product called SpamBrain <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-releases-december-2022-link-spam-update-390336" target="_blank">24</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/spam-updates" target="_blank">25</a></sup> which optimises detection of spam.  A fortnight before they released a “helpful content update” <sup><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update" target="_blank">26</a></sup> which tries to improve the relevance of search results.  I guess they need to check behavioural outcomes from the SERPs/ results against multiple exo-bytes of raw index-data, and billions of searches, to be sure about no regressions.</p>


<h2 class="dontend" id="toc4"> <a href="#toc4" title="Jump to this section." > Information retrieval.  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h2>
<p>Information retrieval was the research focus of my first degree, I could see that this an important trend. This is not quite the same as SEO.  The rate of acquiring new information in computer systems increases every year. This is why we need good search tools.  SEO is a process that helps users' “search”, as far as well-built systems are more searchable.  Search is more interesting to me, but not relevant to this article.</p>


<h4 class="dontend" id="toc5"> <a href="#toc5" title="Jump to this section." > My site (...this is ploddy) <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h4>
<p>This guy keeps talking about SEO, what is he doing?</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>I have many outbound links.  I will not try to trap users on my site, as I only expect tech literate people to want to read it; and these can't be trapped.</li>
    <li>I am clearly writing articles on defined subjects <sup><a href="https://searchengineland.com/quality-content-factors-list-thats-actually-helpful-213796" target="_blank">27</a></sup>, not vague marketing hype.   These are subjects that I know about, not vague “three statements for and three statements against” opinion pieces.  I do plenty of research per article.</li>
    <li>In theory I am linking back to my site on social media.</li>
    <li>I have clear meta-data; I have clear titles; I have used micro-formats.  I have used all the HTML5 tags to improve semantics.  The data structure is in clear English (e.g. the URL space, and internal links etc).</li>
    <li>The page content is the same if you don't use the CSS or JS.  The raw byte-order data is in a good sequence for screen readers and search-engines.  As is common, my RWD design site works with a variety of devices.   </li>
    <li>The following are less important, can are done quite simply.<ul class="ulbasic">
        <li>Most ~ if not all ~ of my internal links are annotated.</li>
        <li>Marketeers would have a mailing list <sup><a href="https://www.mailpoet.com/blog/newsletter-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank">28</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank">29</a></sup>.  </li>
        <li>I should engineer organic reach <sup><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/13-secrets-thatll-boost-your-facebook-organic-reach/" target="_blank">30</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/increase-organic-facebook-reach-tips/" target="_blank">31</a></sup> via facebook as I am told this is where people get news from <sup><a href="https://fortune.com/2015/07/14/twitter-facebook-news-sources/" target="_blank">32</a></sup>, but I don't have the time, and I not sure its worth the effort.</li>
