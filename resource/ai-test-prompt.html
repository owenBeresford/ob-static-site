<p>A useful system needs to have every LLM step reviewed carefully.  A systematic set of test prompts is  good baseline to showing compliance to various laws, and will show areas where the base data for the LLM was sparse.   It is essential that this area of testing involves domain experts, but their involvement can be done with a UI of their choice (I guess Excel would be a common answer).  As an off-the-cuff validation, I would execute each domain area multiple times to see if there was extra hidden associations that the LLM was storing.<br />
As a separate batch of testing, whilst the LLM is under training, some products / projects have a tweak step, where feedback is given to the LLM about its current answers, so later editions will be more useful.  This version of testing is to catch noise responses that are obviously irrelevant trash (earlier in product life-cycle means cheaper, see graph on <sup><a href="https://machine-learning-made-simple.scribe.rip/how-to-build-unit-tests-for-llms-using-prompt-testing-f59c3826ed0e" target="_blank">1</a></sup> ).   As LLM are a series of layers, the extra “de-weighting” of noise responses could be an extra layer of evaluation ~ this alteration is easy and modular. <br />
Thirdly, some products have improved reasoning skills, this was achieved after a large volume of intermediate tests.  This process isn't covered in this section, but is a step that would need to happen.   <br />
When testing, I start by defining the limits of the requirements, ideally before I write the software.  So I wrote this outline, which in the absence of the product project is pointless.  For a plain App with less crunching on user input, I may be less picky about boundary cases on the input.<br />
The three items I marked as paranoia are,  if present, not reported in media, but seem a useful backstop.<br />
NOTE: Some LLM devs are skipping over “write a unit test” process as the only important thing is the test Fixture.   But then you loose all the background support features, like duration reporting, the ability to measure RAM used, bulk scheduling etc, so I would discourage skipping the unit-test.   These smaller details are cheap and often library features.</p>

<p>Due to LLM ingesting a large amount of random text made by humans, <i>note that human attention isn't even</i>.   When I was a small child it was quoted “Eskimos have 17 words for snow” as an annoying factoid before cheap internet was available.   Stepping round who is an 'eater of raw fish' term ~ many prefer Inuit ~ a quick search has a number closer to 50 words for frozen water <sup><a href="https://www.caslt.org/en/blog-discovering-languages-inuktut/" target="_blank">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/05/03/inuits-50-words-snow-british-equivalent-20764599/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.   The important point is that they are not words for “snow”, but words for frozen water.   There are many different states of frozen water that may kill you, and detailed knowledge and being able to communicate about the frozen water is necessary for survival in the Arctic.   Arctic people have this level of precision as it helps them, but it will not help some office dweller in a more southern city.  For me, my words for snow are nearly completely talking about fake-snow ~ like animation effects ~ as it doesn't snow near London.   A challenge for older UK people: list how many words you have for damp / water logged ground ~ this will cross 17 quite quickly.</p>

A thorough set of notes for how to make a good set of test prompts <sup><a href="https://www.multimodal.dev/post/llm-prompting" target="_blank">9</a></sup>, I try to limit duplicating the references, and it isn't that complex.

<p>The following are from <sup><a href="https://testsigma.com/blog/prompt-engineering-for-testers/" target="_blank">11</a></sup>, and seem to be BDD templates::</p>

<p>The source ~ TestSigma ~ is a tool, and supports manual and automated tests for prompts and LLM <sup><a href="https://thectoclub.com/tools/testsigma-review/" target="_blank">13</a></sup>.  It is a paid-for tool, and I am unaware of a data export capacity, which is essential for third party hosted tests.  It has strong NLP features which will support the human interaction to make tests ~ “tests in plain english”.   As this is for prompts, its the same idea as Selenium, but completely different interactions.   There are competitors to TestSigma, try TestRigor<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=TestRigor">?</a> <sup><a href="https://testrigor.com/" target="_blank">14</a></sup> reviewed <sup><a href="https://www.repeato.app/testsigma-vs-testrigor/" target="_blank">15</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://testrigor.com/blog/vision-ai-and-how-testrigor-uses-it/" target="_blank">16</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The reason why you need to test is because, with the above tools, the fact that a retailable product needs to meet legal requirements.  A framework is needed for covering the complex problem domain, as to do this manually is far too expensive.  Here are several software frameworks to reduce the cost of this quality-adding step.</p>

<summary><h3> Test plan for a chatbot </h3></summary>
<p>Test preconditions that need to exist:</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>A correctly setup websocket based comms layer</li>
    <li>Some sort of GUI that can communicate with users [NOT IN TEST]</li>
    <li>A correctly setup logging system, for auditing, under a different user account to the LLM</li>
    <li>The “service under test” correctly setup, that will read data from the websocket, and respond</li>
    <li>A correctly setup knowledge base linked to the chatbot (knowledge of “our” products)</li>
    <li>It SHOULD have API access to local stock control, so the chatbot only sells things that exist</li>
    <li>If a medical product, there are several sets of medical data process that need complying to <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information" target="_blank">2</a></sup> </li>
    <li>[PARANOIA] The knowledge base also holds relevant legal constraints</li>
    <li>[PARANOIA] The knowledge base also holds relevant tax process constraints</li>
    <li>[PARANOIA] The knowledge base also holds “common knowledge” of competitors</li>
</ul>

<p>Context boundary tests :</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>If the chatbot was a human, the 'call' would be logged, demonstrate that logging is happening correctly</li>
    <li>Idle connection, or very slow input (a low power DoS)</li>
    <li>If the input is very large, being sensible (...trim?)</li>
    <li>If locales are set, knowing a client has wrong locale, and aborting </li>
    <li>If the input is in a unrecognised charset, </li>
    <li>Check no extra behaviour as a side effect of users name</li>
    <li>Handling for inconsistent data (e.g. account number and passphrase don't match) </li>
    <li>Handling for expired data (e.g. account number for a closed account)</li>
    <li>Handling for unknown account ids </li>
    <li>Handling XYZ layers of user identification</li>
    <li>Diplomatic handling for “bad words”</li>
    <li>Knowing when a prompt is too expensive, and aborting</li>
    <li>Change the charset in requests, is this accepted?</li>
    <li>Partial UTF8 char, what blows up?</li>
    <li>Partial UTF16 char, what blows up?</li>
    <li>Partial win32 wide char, what blows up?</li>
    <li>Make a clear policy for acceptable human languages.  Enforce this.</li>
    <li>Assuming user accounts, check name is returned in correct places, and in expected style</li>
</ul>

<p>Scale and performance tests :</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>How many concurrent requests are stable?</li>
    <li>How fast is standard-query-1 (repeat for each test fixture)?</li>
    <li>How stable is a big input again?</li>
    <li>Are there are any subjects where the queries get slow, as the original source was much more verbose (see the snow example above)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Generative content LLM tests need to :</p>

<ul class="ulbasic">
    <li>Check can sell owned stock currently available</li>
    <li>Check can't sell previous stock</li>
    <li>Check can correctly sell projected but not currently available stock</li>
    <li>Check can offer correct product from a good match</li>
    <li>Check can offer correct product from a weak match, maybe a range</li>
    <li>Check can offer correct product from a description of a competitor's product</li>
    <li>Check can't sell competitors stock</li>
    <li>Ensure that all offers are inside tax codes</li>
    <li>Ensure that all offers are inside legal codes (e.g. no alcohol to children)</li>
    <li>Can offer RMA correctly</li>
    <li>Can offer refund correctly</li>
    <li>Show that Responses are complete (suggest: needs internal debug data)</li>
    <li>Show that Responses are relevant, outside of above product display tests (suggest: needs internal debug data)</li>
    <li>Doesn't make things awkward with inappropriate stereotyping</li>
    <li>When fed random data, behaves normally</li>
    <li>Show that the legally required PII filters work</li>
    <li>Show that US PHR laws are complied with (very relevant to AI) and HIPAA, maybe relevant to AI.  </li>
    <li>For the EU, show compliance to German privacy laws (strict)</li>
    <li>Masking/suppressing for injection prompts </li>
    <li>Show that inline control signals are not accepted from the end users (where different to previous). </li>
    <li>Responses have low-to-no Toxity.  <i>I need to run this test manually, to know what the requirement should precisely be.</i> </li>
    <li>Test for known but false information, like events that only happened in one film.</li>
    <li>Try to order pizza, as an example of a sales transaction that will be on the internet (ASSERT: that pizza is not a product offered)</li>
    <li>Ramble for a bit, then ask a question</li>
    <li>Ramble on like an old person, and don't ask a question</li>
    <li>NEED TO EXTEND HERE</li>
</ul>

<p>A complete and useful “initial state prompt” would read like a normal program.  Some of the tests can be generated by using one of the tools listed halfway down <sup><a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/05/how-to-evaluate-a-large-language-model-llm/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>.  The way some people describe the LLM makes it similar [XXX] to a mass of <i>if statements</i> that normaly are ~ this input has this output ~ but unfortunately <i>if statements</i> here don't have many / any tests.</p>
