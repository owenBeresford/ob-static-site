<h3 class="dontend" id="toc2"> <a href="#toc2" title="Jump to this section." > My easy maquette (HTML + CSS)  <sup><i class="fa fa-link invert" aria-label="Jump this to this section." aria-hidden="true"></i></sup> </a></h3>
<p>To write from scratch, this would take a day or something (mostly testing on each browser).   I am merging in common assets in quite a few places.   Note this is not using any JS, leaving a lighter and smaller App.   The CSS has been written from scratch, but is short.   Historical plugins were more than 100KB large, and ran slower.<br />
As a random webpage, I haven't included several meg of out-of-date code in the current maquette.</p>


<details class="singlePopup" >

<p>This bit does feel like a childs homework, but here is a larger image.  This larger image is in apparent camera resolution of about 2000px across.  Note lazy loading without JS for better experience.

<h5 id="toc4"> History (skippable)</h5>
<ol>
    <li>This is split into decades, to be shorter, but events and tech roll-out do not match decade boundaries.  Note, a computer life-cycle is about three years (JS frameworks, work laptops, etc), so a decade of a “human-time” is a long time.   A very long time ago (1990 era) the internet was too slow for casual images.   Screen resolutions where 300-800 pixels across.</li>
    <li>In about 2000, the internet used to be slower than today, and desktop based.  Desktop screens had more colours than before, and a higher resolution (say 1024 across).   Looking at images on the internet was a bigger user journey (I'm not talking about pron).   As less people had digital cameras so there was less images available.   The user journey “look at my image gallery” held interest for less technical users.   Secondly digital cameras were less high resolution for all but the really expensive ones.   Thirdly there was less advanced browsers and related technology.   So early web-developers used to make a gallery of small <i>faster</i> loading images, with links to click for the bigger version of the same images. </li>
    <li>By about 2010, everyone in the EU had DSL, a larger screen again and a 'smart' mobile.   A current viewer would just call that “my phone” or similar.   Smart phones often have a camera, leading to a proliferation of images being created.   Interest in personal image galleries was gone, as everyone had moved to social media.   It was much easier to have images hosted on the SM companies servers.   <em>Companies</em> had image galleries for their products, as the faster internet meant net-shopping was practical.  There was expanded infrastructure (like HTTP 1.1 pipelining), and better caching.  JS was widely used to make more complex features.    A JS library called jQuery was used widely.    Screen sizes had climbed to 1800 pixels across on desktops, 1200 for laptops, and 600 for mobile.   One could buy a large expensive Mac with a resolution of 5000 pixels across. </li>
    <li>By 2020, phones were released with bigger screens and had better CPUs, and general performance.   Doing most internet activity via your phone was common, outside of office-work activities.   Internet speeds have increased again, and everyone uses streaming media.  The JS libraries that are used for SPA architecture are common (React, Vue, Angular).   Technology has expanded with market size and maturity again, HTTP2 and HTTPS are used for everything, and most assets are held in a CDN or Edge network like Cloudflare.   Good Apps use images to fit the screen-size of the device being used, via various approaches.   </li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE: For DIALOG elements, there is new CSS for backgrounds <i>::backdrop</i> <sup><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop" target="_blank">1</a></sup> so no glass pane container is needed anymore.</p>
